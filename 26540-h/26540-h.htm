<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE PLOT AGAINST THE GATUN DAM.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Five Black Bears, two Wolves, and a Panther.
That would be a choice collection of wild
animals to take to the Canal Zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark was greeted with shouts of laughter,
and then the boys in the handsome clubroom
of the Black Bear Patrol, in the city of New York,
settled down to a serious discussion of the topic
of the evening. There were seven present, Ned
Nestor and Jimmie McGraw, of the Wolf Patrol;
George Tolford, Harry Stevens, Glen Howard,
and Jack Bosworth, of the famous Black Bear
Patrol; and Peter Fenton, of the Panther Patrol.
They ranged in age from thirteen to seventeen,
Jimmie being the youngest and Ned Nestor the
oldest of the group.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>They were all enthusiastic Boy Scouts, and
their clubrooms were well supplied with boxing
gloves, foils, and footballs, as well as weapons
and articles necessary on camping expeditions.
The clubroom in which the boys were assembled
on this gusty night in early April was situated in
the upper part of the fine residence of Jack&#8217;s
father, on Fifth avenue. The Black Bear
Patrol was composed almost entirely of the sons
of very wealthy parents, and the boys were off
to the woods and waters whenever opportunity
offered.</p>
<p>In company with Lieutenant Gordon, of the
United States Secret Service, and Frank Shaw,
a member of the Black Bear Patrol, whose arrival
was momentarily expected, the boys present
had, on the previous day, returned from a series
of unusual and exciting experiences in Mexico,
and now they were discussing a proposed plan for
an excursion to the Canal Zone. Of course they
could make the trip if they desired, but what
they wanted was to go in the company of Lieutenant
Gordon, sent there on a secret mission by
the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, come on, Ned, an&#8217; be a good feller,&#8221;
Jimmie McGraw urged, as Nestor expressed
a doubt as to the advisability of taking the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
on the Canal Zone trip, to which he had been
invited by the lieutenant, both as assistant and
companion. &#8220;Let us go! We&#8217;ll talk the lieutenant
into letting us go along if you&#8217;ll say a good
word for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the trip to Mexico to which reference
has been made, Ned Nestor had succeeded in
averting serious complications between the government
of that rebellious republic and the
government of the United States. Through his
efforts a threatened raid across the Rio Grande
from the Mexican side had been checked on the
very border, and the secret service men associated
with him did not hesitate to declare that
his tact and activity had done much to prevent a
war between the two countries.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene of their operations
in Mexico, Lieutenant Gordon had been ordered
to New York on important official business.
Only an inkling of what that official business
was contained in his letter of instructions. Only
the bare fact that complications in the Canal
Zone were placing the Panama Canal in danger
was conveyed to him. Later, after his arrival
in New York, he had learned that the government
suspected plots to destroy the great Gatun
dam by the use of explosives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>Only a hint of the threatened danger had
been conveyed to the War department, but that
was enough to set on foot the investigation of
which Lieutenant Gordon was to be the head.
One of the lieutenant&#8217;s first acts after receiving
his instructions was to secure the services of Ned
Nestor, being guided in this by the wonderful
success of the boy&#8217;s efforts in Mexico.</p>
<p>Thus it chanced that on this night every boy
who had had the good fortune to share in the
Mexican adventures was importuning Nestor
to use his influence with the lieutenant in order
that they might all be taken into the party.
They had already gained the consent of their
parents, Nestor, individually, was willing, and
it only remained to convince Lieutenant Gordon
that they could be of use to him and the government
on the Canal Zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t loosen up and take us with
you,&#8221; Harry Stevens declared, with a grin in the
direction of his companions, &#8220;we&#8217;ll give you a
chase to the equator. You know how you found
Jimmie in George&#8217;s bed? Well, if you don&#8217;t
take us along with you, you&#8217;ll find us all in your
bed before you get to Panama.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a pity to unload such a mess of wild
animals on the people of the Zone,&#8221; laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Nestor, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll leave it all to Lieutenant
Gordon. Lavish your honeyed words and smiles
on him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, anyway?&#8221; demanded
Jimmie. &#8220;It&#8217;s something concerning the big
canal, I know, for I heard you two talking of
explosives at the Gatun dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all heard that,&#8221; cried Jack Bosworth.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t keep secrets from us. What is it all
about? Is some one trying to blow up the big
dam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nestor looked into the faces of the boys with
serious eyes. He had not suspected that they
knew anything definite regarding the secret
mission, and was annoyed to think that he in part
might be to blame for the leak which had been
discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what you&#8217;re going for?&#8221; asked Harry
Stevens. &#8220;Are you going to mix with governmental
affairs again? Because we&#8217;ve got to go
if you are. Honest, now, we won&#8217;t say a word
if you tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you all promise that?&#8221; asked Nestor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we do,&#8221; came in chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; Nestor went on, &#8220;we don&#8217;t
know much about the matter, except that there
are hostile influences at work down there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
directed against the canal. We do not know the
proposed point of attack, but presume that the
big dam is in the greatest danger. We do
not even know where to look for the plotters, or
whether they are Americans or of foreign birth.
The motive for the contemplated destruction of
the great waterway is not even surmised. In
fact, for all we know, this may be a scare, but
the thing is serious enough to call for rigid investigation,
so down there we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you can&#8217;t get along without us!&#8221;
cried Jimmie. &#8220;If you want to know who is
at the bottom of it all, just ask me. It&#8217;s the
railroads. I&#8217;ve heard men say the canal would
have been finished years ago only for the determined
opposition of the transcontinental
lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much you know about it!&#8221; cried Harry
Stevens. &#8220;If anybody should ask you where
to look for the trouble, put your finger on the
map of Japan. The little brown men are digging
under the Gatun dam if any one is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not seem possible that either the
Japanese government or the railroad interests
would descend to such despicable work,&#8221; Nestor
said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t believe it of either of them until
I have absolute proof.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It would be going some to blow up the
Gatun dam,&#8221; Peter Fenton cut in. &#8220;Why,
when finished, that dam will be more than a
hundred feet high, and will cover one hundred
and sixty-four square miles with water. Its
purpose is to huddle the highland streams into a
lake which will become a part of the canal. This
lake will cover plantations, small farms, villages,
and even the present right of way of the Panama
railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they succeed in blowing up the Gatun
dam,&#8221; Jack said, &#8220;there will be no Canal Completion
Exposition in San Francisco in four
years. That would be a shame, for we were all
going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of all that land being put down in the
bed of a lake!&#8221; Harry Stevens exclaimed. &#8220;We
ought to have taken a tip when the canal was
first talked about and bought up that property.
Uncle Sam would have bought it of us at a fancy
price. Just think of a sure-thing speculation
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Fenton, known as the Encyclopedia,
sat back in his chair and laughed until his face
was as red as the painted snout of the black bear
which looked down from a shield on the wall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
The boys shook him up until he regained the
power of speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you boys had been one year old when the
Panama Canal was first mentioned,&#8221; he managed
to say, choking back his laughter, &#8220;you
would now stand at the venerable age of four
hundred and sixteen years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you get your history in the dream
book,&#8221; Jimmie cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nixy dream book,&#8221; declared Peter, with
the dignity which comes of much knowledge.
&#8220;The Spaniards who lived in the Province of
New Granada, on the Isthmus of Darien, as it
was then called, planned a ship canal across the
neck in the year 1518, and there has been talk
of the big ditch ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it takes a long time to get at the job,&#8221;
suggested Jimmie. &#8220;The trench could have
been scooped out with a teaspoon in less than
four hundred years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you get down there! You&#8217;ll
see what impression your teaspoon would make.
I&#8217;ve been reading up since I&#8217;ve returned to New
York, and know something about the size of the
job. The canal will cost millions more than
Congress figured on, and the job is going ahead
without graft, at that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; Harry Stevens interrupted, &#8220;it would
have been a wise move to have annexed a lot of
that land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your speculation had developed when the
first talk of the canal was heard,&#8221; Peter went on,
&#8220;you would have had to do business with King
Ferdinand, of Spain. He would have put the
soil on the bargain counter for you one day and
shot you up the next. That wouldn&#8217;t have been
so cheerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice party to do business with,&#8221; laughed
Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was next to his king job, all right,&#8221;
Peter continued. &#8220;He was there with the gunpowder
when any subject stood to put anything
over on him. He caused Columbus to be returned
to Spain in chains, and permitted one of
his officials to shoot up the first white man who
ever looked out on the Pacific from the divide
of the Isthmus. He carried things by a large
majority, did Ferdinand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was his queen who put her jewels in soak
to buy a ship for Columbus,&#8221; commented
Jack Bosworth. &#8220;I read about it when I was
laid up with my broken arm. You remember
the time the horse climbed into my motor car?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The police say you never stopped running
until you bumped against one of the White
Mountains,&#8221; laughed Harry. &#8220;Who was this
white man who first climbed the divide?&#8221; he
asked; &#8220;as I&#8217;m going down there, I want to know.
I may set up a monument to his memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure about going,&#8221; warned
Glen Howard. &#8220;Lieutenant Gordon may kick
on the whole bunch of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll all go down in my motor boat,&#8221;
replied Harry. &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep me out of the
Canal Zone when there&#8217;s things doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s name was Balboa,&#8221; said Peter,
in answer to the question, as he smiled at this
tardy recognition of the services of the explorer.
&#8220;He went broke at St. Domingo, one day in the
year 1510, and hired a fellow to head him up in a
wine cask and put the cask on board a ship
bound for Darien. He made the trip, all right,
and landed broke, but in three years he was captain
of the precinct, as they say in Manhattan,
and on his way to the Pacific. He looked out on
the big ocean for the first time on the 26th of
September, 1513. Some say it was the 25th.
I don&#8217;t know which is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door of the clubroom now opened and
Lieutenant Gordon entered. He was a man of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
not more than thirty, with a stern though not
forbidding face and an alert military figure.
His brown eyes lighted up with sudden humor as
he dodged the clamorous boys, and dropped into
a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221; asked Jimmie, who seemed
to be a favorite with the officer. &#8220;Do we go
with you, or do we trail along in the motor boat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man higher up,&#8221; began the lieutenant,
&#8220;says you may go with me if you will try to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no necessity for the lieutenant
going on with the sentence. He had warned the
boys so many times as to their conduct on the
Isthmus, if permitted to go with the secret service
men, that they now knew in advance what
he was going to say, and they repeated his former
admonitions with shouts of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the lieutenant, trying to
look dignified, &#8220;if you won&#8217;t listen you can&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on an&#8217; talk your chin off,&#8221; shouted
Jimmie. &#8220;We&#8217;ll listen to every word until our
arms drop to the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; laughed the officer.
&#8220;I&#8217;m too busy at present to speak the advice
you&#8217;ll all forget before I&#8217;m out of the room.
Where is Frank Shaw? I came here to see him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was coming down to-night,&#8221; George
Tolford replied, &#8220;but it is so late now that he
may not be here. Anything special?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I want to
know what he has been saying to his father about
the difficulty in the Canal Zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he doesn&#8217;t know anything to tell,&#8221;
said Nestor, &#8220;not even as much as the boys here
now know, for I have talked the situation over
with them but not with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they know regarding the situation?&#8221;
asked the lieutenant, apprehensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing except that the Panama canal is
threatened by some unknown influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the lieutenant, thoughtfully,
&#8220;some one has been leaking, and it seems as if
our first move in the game must be made right
here in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Frank that leaked,&#8221; Jimmie asserted,
in defense of his friend. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t
do such a thing, and he couldn&#8217;t tell what he
didn&#8217;t know, anyway,&#8221; with which logical conclusion
the boy turned his back to the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something wrong somewhere,&#8221;
Lieutenant Gordon said. &#8220;Wait until I tell
you what took place this afternoon and you will
agree with me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THEFT OF THE EMERALD NECKLACE.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Early this afternoon,&#8221; the lieutenant went
on as the boys gathered about him, &#8220;I was interviewed
by a reporter for the <i>Daily Planet</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank&#8217;s father owns that newspaper,&#8221;
Jimmie suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the officer, &#8220;and that is why I
thought Frank might know something of the
origin of the inquiry. The reporter was not
slow in getting at the point he was in my rooms
to discuss. Almost the first question he asked
me was this: &#8216;Is it true that the government
has ordered you to the Canal Zone to investigate
an alleged plot to blow up the Gatun dam?&#8217;
Coming from a reporter, as it did, the question
knocked me all in a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned Nestor leaned forward with a new interest
showing in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What did
you tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to bluff him out at first, but soon
learned that he knew more about the Zone situation
than I did. He didn&#8217;t get much information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
from me, but I learned from him that the <i>Daily
Planet</i> is wise to the whole situation, as the
boys say. Now, the question is this: &#8216;Where
did the editor secure his information?&#8217; I asked
him in so many words, but he only laughed at
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The place to go for that information,&#8221;
Nestor suggested, &#8220;is to the editor himself.
Mr. Shaw would, of course, know all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what I thought,&#8221; said
the lieutenant, &#8220;so I lost no time in getting to
the editorial rooms. Mr. Shaw was there, and
treated me very courteously, but the only satisfaction
I could get from him was the information
that he knew something of what was going on,
and was doing his best to secure enough facts
regarding the matter for a news story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be able to get more than that out of
him,&#8221; George ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; the lieutenant said, &#8220;for he is
afraid some rival newspaper will get an inkling
of the matter and beat him out on the sensation
he is preparing. It seems that his men have
discovered documentary evidence of some sort,
papers which might be of great value in the hands
of the government.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he give you a hint as to the contents
of the papers?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he wouldn&#8217;t even give me an idea as
to the parties he suspects. I think he might
have done that, in the interest of good government.
Well, of course his information is his
own, but he might have trusted me not to betray
his confidence to his rivals. I must confess that
I don&#8217;t like his attitude in the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers may contain nothing the government
could use,&#8221; Ned observed, &#8220;although their
value to the newspaper may be great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to get a look at them, all the
same,&#8221; said Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would call off his reporters,&#8221; Ned
went on. &#8220;If they go about the city asking the
questions they asked of you, the plotters will
soon know that they are being watched, and that
will make their capture more difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the idea,&#8221; exclaimed the lieutenant.
&#8220;Perhaps we can get him to let the case alone
for a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is doubtful,&#8221; Ned said, &#8220;but there is
one ray of light in the situation. If the plotters
find out that the editor of the <i>Daily Planet</i> has
documentary evidence against them, they may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
try to steal the papers, and so disclose their
identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would steal them myself if I got a chance,&#8221;
laughed Gordon. &#8220;The government needs every
pointer it can get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better let the others try first,&#8221; advised
Nestor, with a smile. &#8220;It really does begin to
look as if the first move in this Panama game
might be made right here in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know where Shaw got the pointer,&#8221;
Gordon said, in a moment. &#8220;I thought at
first that Frank might have let out something
in asking permission to go to the Zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know a thing about it,&#8221; Jimmie
put in, warm in the defense of his friend. &#8220;How
could he drop a hint, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was something said about the situation
in Panama before we left the Sierra del
Fierro mountains in Mexico,&#8221; said Nestor, &#8220;but
I can&#8217;t for the life of me tell just what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nothing definite,&#8221; said Harry Stevens,
&#8220;for I had forgotten all about it. There
was some talk about our going to the Canal Zone,
but nothing was decided on, and the plot against
the government wasn&#8217;t mentioned. At least that
is my best recollection of the talk there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was something more than that said,&#8221;
the lieutenant observed, &#8220;but that is unimportant
now. The thing to do, if we can, is to stop
this investigation by the <i>Daily Planet</i>. The
reporters will let the cat out of the bag and the
interests back of the plot will either act immediately,
before we can check them, or delay the
matter until everything in connection with it
is forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the papers collected by the <i>Daily
Planet</i> people give any inkling of the motive
which is leading the plotters on,&#8221; Nestor said,
&#8220;we really ought to get hold of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are as bad as the lieutenant,
and would steal them yourself if you got a
chance,&#8221; grinned Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would at least try to get a look at them,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, fellows!&#8221; George Tolford cried,
excitedly, &#8220;I think I know where Mr. Shaw got
his pointer. It is this way: Mr. Shaw is interested
in Zone property, and owns a large block
of stock in an emerald mine. He spent most of
the past winter on the Isthmus, and there is
where he unearthed the story. You take it from
me that this is right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That view of the case makes it all the more
imperative that we learn the contents of the
papers Mr. Shaw has,&#8221; said the lieutenant, rising
and pacing the room excitedly. &#8220;If he got
his information on the Isthmus, it is more than
likely that it points out not only the motive but
also the interest which is planning the outrage.
I must send some high official to talk with Mr.
Shaw. He is interested in an emerald mine,
you say?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he is,&#8221; replied George Tolford. &#8220;Frank
told me all about it not long ago, at the time he
showed me an emerald necklace his father gave
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An emerald necklace,&#8221; repeated Jimmie.
&#8220;What you gettin&#8217; at? Boys don&#8217;t wear necklaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This emerald necklace,&#8221; George went on,
&#8220;is as old as the hills. Frank says the stones
were taken out of a mine in a valley in the interior
of Colombia four hundred years ago. There
are twenty-five stones, each weighing over six
carats. Taken separately, the stones are worth
a thousand each, and together their price is
fabulous. Frank says the necklace formerly
belonged to some secret order of natives, and that
$100,000 has been offered for it because of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
perfectly matched stones, and because of its
wonderful history. It is a peach, I can tell you
that, and Frank will never go broke as long as he
sticks to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that there were any emeralds
down that way,&#8221; Glen Howard said. &#8220;We
will bring a couple of carloads back with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Emeralds down that way!&#8221; repeated Peter
Fenton. &#8220;Why, the best emeralds in the world
are found in South America. The very best are
found in veins traversing clay-slate, hornblende
slate, and granite, in a little valley not far from
Bogota, the capital of the United States of
Colombia. Inferior stones are found imbedded
in mica slate in Europe. You see I&#8217;ve been
reading up on South America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way,&#8221; laughed Lieutenant
Gordon. &#8220;I must get a look at Frank&#8217;s emerald
necklace before I leave New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may find one like it in the ruins of
Spanish Panama,&#8221; said Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess there ain&#8217;t many ruins around Panama,&#8221;
declared Jimmie. &#8220;Not many ruins anywhere
Uncle Sam&#8217;s soldiers are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; persisted Peter, &#8220;the Panama
built by the Spaniards in the year 1518 is
now in ruins, unless it has been restored since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the Americans took possession of the Canal
Zone. It lies six miles to the northeast of the
present city of that name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Frank would drop in to-night,&#8221; the
lieutenant said, after a pause. &#8220;I have an idea
that he might suggest something of value just
now, some way in which his father may be
reached. We are leaving for the Zone on Thursday
morning, so have only one more day in the
city, consequently there is no time to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys fairly shrieked their appreciation
of the information that they were to depart for
the Isthmus so soon, and gathered about Lieutenant
Gordon with extended hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must understand this,&#8221; the lieutenant
said, returning the greetings heartily,
&#8220;you are not supposed to be in my company at
all. I may need to talk with some of you, but if
I do it will be in a casual manner, just as one
tourist might address another. I am traveling
alone, understand. I shall stop at the Tivoli, at
Ancon, a short distance from Panama, and you
will have a cottage in the jungle, near Gatun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we are to ramble about wherever we
like?&#8221; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever you like,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;only
you must not look me up unless in case of serious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
trouble. I&#8217;ll communicate with you when necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys all agreed to the conditions readily
enough; they would have consented to almost
any arrangement in order to be taken on the
trip. After the details were disposed of, Ned
called the lieutenant aside and asked him a most
surprising question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really thinking of trying to steal
those papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a great mind to make the attempt,&#8221;
was the smiling reply. &#8220;We need them in our
business, and, besides, the government has
plenty of men here who may as well be working
on this case as any other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is on the theory that the papers may
reveal to you the nature of the plot and the
names of the plotters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the idea, exactly. I have no doubt
now that Mr. Shaw secured his pointers while
on the Isthmus, and the papers doubtless contain
information which it might take us months
to procure. Yes, I think I shall set men at work
on the case to-morrow. Besides getting the papers,
we will rob Shaw of his sensation. A publication
of the situation just now would be a
calamity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Nestor said, modestly, &#8220;that I see
a way to accomplish the ends you seek without
resorting to larceny. Will you promise me that
you will do nothing further in the matter of the
documents until I have talked with you again on
the subject?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is imperative that we act quickly,&#8221;
protested the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that,&#8221; Nestor replied, &#8220;but,
all the same, I think I see a way to gain our ends
by keeping out of the way at present. Will you
promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Have your own way about it. I
can set the men at work just before we leave
New York, and the information contained in the
papers can be sent to me by code. Have your
own way, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Nestor said, and the two
returned to the main room. The &#8217;phone in a
closet near the door was ringing sharply, and
Harry Stevens entered the closet and shut the
door. In a moment exclamations of dismay and
surprise were heard issuing from the other side
of the closed door, and then Harry bounced back
into the room, his face white, his eyes shining
with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked half a dozen voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Gordon and Ned are wanted at
Shaw&#8217;s house at once,&#8221; the boy said. &#8220;Go on
the run, boys, for there is something stirring
there. Mr. Shaw has been chloroformed, the
servants knocked about like tenpins, and Frank&#8217;s
emerald necklace has been stolen. We&#8217;ll wait
here for news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; the lieutenant said, looking Nestor
in the eyes, &#8220;you were waiting for the interests
back of this thing to show their hand by
trying to get the papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Nestor, &#8220;I had an idea the
interests would try to do a little stealing on their
own hook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they have secured the papers&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant hesitated, and Nestor went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;If they have secured the papers, they know
no more now than they did before. They are not
out after information concerning their own plots.
They are trying to reduce the outside supply of
knowledge about their movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing said about papers being
stolen, was there?&#8221; asked the lieutenant. &#8220;Perhaps
the necklace really was the point of attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nestor turned to George Tolford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where Frank kept his necklace?&#8221;
he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I do,&#8221; was the quick reply. &#8220;He kept
it in a hinky-dinky little safe up in his room.
I told him he was foolish to take such a risk
with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he keep the safe locked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Locked! Not half the time. He would
rush in there, open it up, and then run all over
the house, leaving the door swinging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nestor and the lieutenant now left the room,
after asking the boys to wait there for a short
time. Once out on the street, the lieutenant
remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;If the necklace was kept in Frank&#8217;s room,
why did the thief take the pains to chloroform
Mr. Shaw, who must have been in his own
room?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nestor shrugged his shoulders for reply.
That was a point he had already considered.
Again the lieutenant asked a question:</p>
<p>&#8220;If the papers had been taken, wouldn&#8217;t that
have been mentioned the very first thing?
Wouldn&#8217;t Mr. Shaw think first of recovering
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Nestor. &#8220;The
thing for us to do now is to find out who it was
that entered the Shaw house to-night, and what
was taken besides the necklace.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>HOW THE TRICK WAS TURNED.</h3>
</div>

<p>Leaving the boys in the luxurious clubroom
of the Black Bear Patrol, and promising to keep
them posted as to the situation by &#8217;phone,
Lieutenant Gordon and Ned Nestor hastened in
the direction of the Shaw residence, only three
blocks away. A surprise awaited them at the
Shaw door.</p>
<p>When they mounted the marble steps to the
front portal they were astonished to see Jimmie
McGraw standing in the shadow of a column,
waiting for them with a grin on his face. He
pushed the electric button for admittance as
soon as they reached his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; demanded the
lieutenant, trying hard to appear angry with the
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I just come over to tell Frank&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; said the lieutenant,
interrupting. &#8220;If this is the way you obey orders
you can&#8217;t go to the Canal Zone with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; Jimmie began, in a contrite
tone, &#8220;I thought of something, after you left,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
that I wanted to say to Frank, and I knew he&#8217;d
have asked for me if he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; thought of it, so I
just run over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it you wanted to say to Frank?&#8221;
asked the lieutenant, with a smile in Ned&#8217;s
direction. The persistence of the boy pleased
him, to say the least.</p>
<p>Just then the door was opened, saving Jimmie
the exertion of manufacturing a smooth tale
to tell the lieutenant, and the three entered the
great hall of the fine residence, where they found
Frank awaiting them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d both left the clubroom
and couldn&#8217;t be found,&#8221; he cried, as he took his
friends by the hand. &#8220;Come right up to my
room, and I&#8217;ll show you just how the thieves
got the emerald necklace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we ought to see your father first,&#8221;
Lieutenant Gordon suggested, thinking of something
much more important, to him at least, than
the bauble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is with Doctor Benson just now,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he seriously injured?&#8221; asked Nestor,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;They just
sneaked up behind him and stuffed a big handkerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
soaked with chloroform into his face.
The drug knocked him out for a short time, but
he is all right now. He told me to show you my
room as soon as you came, and then to take you
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else is in the house?&#8221; asked Nestor.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one but Doctor Benson and the servants,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the police have not been called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. I asked father to wait until
you two came. I don&#8217;t take much stock in the
cheap plain clothes men they send about on
robbery cases. But come on up to my room, and
I&#8217;ll show you what a sucker I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had said that,&#8221; Jimmie put in, &#8220;you&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; handed me one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Jimmie is on the case too,&#8221; laughed
Frank. &#8220;Well, son, there&#8217;s money in it for the
man who restores my emerald necklace, which
I&#8217;m sure to get back, in the end. Why, that
necklace has been stolen about a thousand times,
and has always been restored to the rightful
owner. Once it was found in the heart of Africa,
in the kinky hair of a native. There&#8217;s blood on
it, too, for men have been killed trying to steal
it, and trying to prevent its being stolen. It&#8217;s
the most valuable necklace in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>The boy mounted the staircase as he spoke,
leading the others to his room, which was at the
front of the house on the second floor, directly
over the apartment used by his father as a
library, or study. The suite occupied by the boy
was elegantly furnished, the only thing which
marred the tasty arrangement of the place being
a steel safe which stood between the two front
windows of the sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Frank, closing the door of the
room behind the little party, &#8220;they got the necklace
out of that safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did they open it?&#8221; asked the lieutenant,
and Jimmie laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank never closed a door in his life,&#8221; the
boy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the safe open?&#8221; asked Lieutenant
Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;it was open. I had
just been there to get some money when I heard
a scrap going on in the corridor and rushed out,
leaving the door open, like a sucker. The necklace
was taken while I was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else taken?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing. Oh, I guess the thief got a
couple of dollars there was in the cash drawer,
but nothing else was disturbed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How long was he in the room?&#8221; asked the
lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, perhaps fifteen minutes. What I mean
is that it must have been about that length of
time before I came back here. You see, when I
got out into the hall, Pedro, that&#8217;s one of Dad&#8217;s
pet servants, was scrapping with two pirate-looking
fellows at the head of the stairs. One of
them had him by the throat when I came up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they both got away?&#8221; asked the
lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they both got away. They turned and
ran down stairs when I came up and bolted out of
the front door, just as if some one stood there
holding it open for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the night-lock on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; it always is at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t anybody open it from the inside,
whether familiar with the house or not?&#8221; asked
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; for the night-bolt is controlled by an
electric button, which you have to push before
it can be moved from the inside, so no one not
familiar with the house could have opened it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nestor glanced at the lieutenant with a question
in his eyes, and the officer nodded. There
was little doubt in the mind of either that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
crime had been planned by some one thoroughly
conversant with the premises. It was at least
certain that exit had been made easy for the
thieves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spent this fifteen minutes, after the
flight of the thieves by way of the front door, in
your father&#8217;s room, I take it?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; when the thieves ducked out of the
front door I found a maid fainting in the corridor
running along back of the parlor to Dad&#8217;s room,
the place where he does his work while in the
house. She flopped over when I spoke to her
and pointed to Dad&#8217;s room. There I found him
lying on the couch, drugged with chloroform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They placed him on the couch, did they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir, the thieves didn&#8217;t take that
trouble. Pedro was there before I entered the
room, and it was he that did that. He had
&#8217;phoned for the doctor, too, before I got into the
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was chasing the thieves?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. He was just ahead of me at
the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how did he get back and do so much
before you reached the study?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I opened the front door and looked out for
a couple of minutes,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
rattled, of course, and don&#8217;t know how long I
stood there, but I remember seeing two men
running down the street. If I had known then
that they had my emerald necklace, I&#8217;d have
chased them and roared until the police came up
and stopped them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you came right in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; right to the corridor where I found
the maid lying on the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you remained with your father until
the doctor came, and then went back to your
room? It was then that you discovered the loss
of the emerald necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I missed it when I came back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw only two intruders?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were only two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And these two ran down the staircase just
ahead of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; they went down in about one leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, was the necklace in the safe when you
went to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certain that it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the case in which it was enclosed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the case was gone when you returned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; oh, the necklace was taken from the
safe during my absence, all right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet the two men were ahead of you, and
went out of the street door before you reached
the lower landing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s face showed that the idea presented
by Nestor was new to him. He had never considered
that feature of the case. In fact, he
had been so excited that he had not thought
logically of the circumstances surrounding the
theft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I reckon I need a hired
man to do my thinking for me. Why didn&#8217;t
that idea get into my thick head before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you still certain that the necklace was
in the safe when you left the room?&#8221; asked Ned,
with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am dead sure of that. Why,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;there must have been a man that I
did not see. Wonder why he didn&#8217;t give me a
clip on the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone will come here an&#8217; steal you, some
day,&#8221; grinned Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;Now,
where do you think the other man was?&#8221; he
asked, turning to Ned.</p>
<p>Ned arose and went into the sleeping room,
from which opened a bathroom and a large
closet. There was a door opening into the sleeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
room from the corridor, the apartment being
of the same length, east and west, as the sitting
room. The closet opened from the sleeping
room, and also from the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you find here?&#8221; asked Frank,
following him into the closet and through into
the bathroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third man might have been hiding in
here,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;When were you in this
bathroom last?&#8221; he added, looking carefully
about the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since early in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The suite was unoccupied all the afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am rarely here in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time did you come up here after
dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was probably eight o&#8217;clock, for Dad was
telling a rather interesting story at table, and we
sat a long time. Mother is away on a visit to
the Pacific coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your father went to his room then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he said he had some work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His room, also, was unoccupied all the afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it must have been.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is usually about the lower part of the
house during the afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one when mother is away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know whether anything was taken
from your father&#8217;s room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t heard that feature of the
case discussed. We can soon find out by asking
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;What would they
want to go an&#8217; dope him for if there wasn&#8217;t something
in his room they wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a very pertinent question,&#8221; Lieutenant
Gordon remarked. &#8220;It certainly seems
that the thieves came here for something besides
the emerald necklace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning the papers?&#8221; asked Ned, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning the papers, of course,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;I am still of the opinion that the theft
of the necklace was only incidental.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It begins to look that way to me,&#8221; observed
Frank. &#8220;As Jimmie says, what would they
attack father for unless they wanted to search
his room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know about the papers?&#8221; asked the
lieutenant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. They constituted the subject
of the interesting story Dad was telling me
at table to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you what they contained?&#8221;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not. He told me only what they
dealt with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He believes there is a plot against the completion
of the Panama canal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he is quite certain of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he mention the parties he suspected?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He refused to do so. I can&#8217;t understand
why he should refuse. Can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can appreciate his position,&#8221;
replied Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; cried Frank. &#8220;Do you think
the agents of the men we are to grapple with in
the Canal Zone have been in this house to-night?
If so, it looks like they were looking us
up, instead of our being after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is this man Pedro?&#8221; asked Ned, not
answering the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in the study when I left, a few
moments ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will go down there. I want to ask
him a few questions.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>At the foot of the staircase, they heard the
telephone ringing, and Frank went into the
closet. When he came out again he seemed
excited and unnerved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s something more than the
necklace at stake to-night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for Dad&#8217;s
rooms in the newspaper building have been ransacked.
I guess we won&#8217;t have to go down to
Gatun to lock horns with the men who are in
this plot against Uncle Sam. If the Gatun dam
was in New York, they might have blown it up
to-night, for all that has been done to thwart
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve just got to work on the case,&#8221;
grinned Jimmie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE MAN IN THE CLOSET.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;If you take my advice,&#8221; Ned said to Frank,
as they reached the study door, &#8220;you won&#8217;t say
anything to your father about the trouble at the
office until we have talked with him concerning
the raid on the house. He might rush off to the
newspaper building immediately, without answering
our questions about the visit to his
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what he would do,&#8221; Frank
replied.</p>
<p>When the boys entered the study, closely
followed by Lieutenant Gordon and Jimmie,
they found three men in the room. One was
Mr. Shaw, lying on a couch at the front of the
apartment. One was Dr. Benson, who sat in
an easy chair at his side. The third was Pedro,
the servant mentioned by Frank as one of his
father&#8217;s favored attendants. He stood by the
couch as the boys stepped into the room, his
bold black eyes studying their faces impertinently
as they entered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>The man was not far from forty, tall, slender,
dusky of face&mdash;plainly in intellectual capacity
and breeding far above the menial position he
occupied in the house. Standing in repose, his
figure was erect and well balanced, like that of a
man trained to military service.</p>
<p>But even as he stood subserviently by the
couch of his employer, his slender hands at his
sides, there seemed to be something of the alertness
of a wild beast in his physical attitude of
suppression. Somehow, he gave Ned the impression
of one about to spring forth upon an
enemy.</p>
<p>After the presentations were made, it was
with the greatest difficulty that Lieutenant
Gordon restrained himself from at once taking
up the topic he had discussed with Mr. Shaw so
unsatisfactorily that afternoon&mdash;the subject of
the plot against the Gatun dam. What did the
editor know? What did he suspect concerning
the raid on his home? Did he believe that the
plotters had opened their defense right there
in the city of New York?</p>
<p>However, he curbed his hasty impulse, knowing
that the information he sought was not to be
obtained in that way. Mr. Shaw was looking
upon the matter entirely from the standpoint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
of an enterprising journalist, and would be cautious
about giving out his own discoveries and
impressions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you still suffering from the effects of
the chloroform?&#8221; asked the lieutenant, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still a little weak,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;and
still a little tippy at the stomach, but Benson
tells me that I shall be well again in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were of course attacked without warning,&#8221;
the lieutenant continued, half hoping that
the editor would enter into a full and frank discussion
of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely so,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I was sitting
at my desk when the door was opened and some
one entered. I thought it was Pedro, for I
had just rung for him, and did not look around.
Then I was seized from behind and a handkerchief
soaked with chloroform thrust into my
face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not see your assailant?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the cross-examination,&#8221; laughed
the editor. &#8220;I have heard something of Mr.
Nestor&#8217;s work in the secret service,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;and shall be glad to answer any of his questions.
Go ahead, my boy. No, to answer your
first question, I did not see my assailant, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
do not know whether there were two or only
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice the time?&#8221; asked Ned,
modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was nine o&#8217;clock. The next I knew,
Pedro was lifting me onto the couch, and a maid
was lifting her voice to high heaven out in the
corridor. That, I have since learned, was at
ten o&#8217;clock, so, you see, the ruffians had an hour
to work in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have mussed the room up quite
a lot in that time,&#8221; said the lieutenant, hoping to
bring the editor to the point in which he was
interested.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw made no reply, but turned to Ned
with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Ned,&#8221; Frank cried. &#8220;We all
want to know what ideas are brooding in that
clever brain of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to ask,&#8221; Ned began, modestly,
&#8220;if you can assign a reason for the attack upon
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they came into the house after the
emerald necklace,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;They
looked here for it first. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it appears that they knew the necklace
to be in Frank&#8217;s safe,&#8221; urged Ned. &#8220;At least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
it did not take them long to find it there after
the safe was unlocked and he was brought from
his room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, they probably looked here first,&#8221;
insisted the editor. &#8220;The manner in which they
rummaged the place while I was unconscious
shows that they searched for it here. The necklace
was the thing sought, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they take anything from the room?&#8221;
asked Ned, and Lieutenant Gordon leaned forward,
anxiously awaiting the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; was the quiet reply. &#8220;At
least, I have missed nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the thing they sought was not
found,&#8221; suggested Gordon, no longer able to
keep the plot subject out of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, Lieutenant,&#8221; the
other replied, &#8220;and I may as well tell you now
that the papers to which you refer are not in the
house&mdash;were not here and never have been here.
They are perfectly safe, and we will drop them
from the case, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am naturally anxious about them,&#8221; said
Gordon, &#8220;in the interest of the government, of
course, for I believe they hold the key to a mystery
I am asked to solve.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may be mistaken as to the contents of
the papers,&#8221; laughed Mr. Shaw. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;we will eliminate them from the matter
in hand. What next, Mr. Nestor? I have great
hope of your success in unraveling this mystery
of the necklace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With your permission,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;and
in your presence, I would like to ask your man a
few questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedro turned a pair of venomous eyes toward
the speaker for just an instant. Then he stood
respectfully looking at his master again. Ned
saw the movement, the quick hostility of the
glance, and felt surer of his ground than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will, I am sure, be happy to answer any
questions you may ask,&#8221; said Mr. Shaw.</p>
<p>Pedro nodded, half defiantly, as though he
felt humiliated by being placed at the service,
even a verbal one, of a boy, and Ned asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you saw the men at the head of the
staircase, what did you say to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer came in perfect English, yet
there was a something in the voice which told as
plainly as words could have done that English
was not the native tongue of the speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered them from the house,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then they attacked you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The mark of a hand is on my throat, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men were there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, sir, and they both piled on top of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no one else in the corridor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were armed, I presume?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw no weapons in their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might have killed you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for the arrival of Master Shaw they
might have done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you describe these men?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can, sir. I was too busy to
notice their faces or their clothes during the short
time I was with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you say whether one of them was tall
and slender, with very black hair, turning gray
in places?&#8221; asked Ned, fixing his eyes on those
of the servant.</p>
<p>Pedro looked back at his questioner for an
instant, and then his gaze fell to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; he replied, slowly, while the
others, amazed at the character of the question,
turned to Ned for explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the description I have given is recognized
by you as that of one of the men you met
in the corridor,&#8221; Ned went on, &#8220;can you tell me
whether his clothing was wet or dry?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>There was dead silence in the room. There
had been nothing thus far in the case leading up
to this description, and those present looked at
Ned with wonder in their faces. To say the
least, the questions seemed irrelevant.</p>
<p>Pedro stood for a moment touching his dry
lips with the tip of his tongue, his fingers clasping
and unclasping, then his shoulders straightened
into firmer lines and he faced his questioner
with a smile of complacency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should have said damp clothing,&#8221;
Ned replied. &#8220;The man I have in mind&mdash;the
man who might have been one of your assailants&mdash;entered
the house just after the rainstorm,
which came on close after six o&#8217;clock. His
clothing was soaking wet when he came in, but
would not remain so for four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedro grasped the back of a chair which
stood near him and looked out of the window to
the lighted street in front of the house. While
he stood silent Mr. Shaw arose to a sitting position
on the couch and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the description, Mr. Nestor? Why the
positive statement about the time at least one of
the men entered the house?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Every eye in the room was now fixed on
Nestor&#8217;s face. Even Lieutenant Gordon seemed
inclined to think that some huge joke was being
pulled off.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who came in at six,&#8221; Ned replied,
&#8220;came in out of the rain, and left marks showing
the height and breadth of his shoulders on a
wall against which he leaned. These marks
show a man tall and slender. He entered the
house dripping with water, moving about like a
street sprinkler and leaving signs of his presence
in the places he visited. He seems to be a person
of rather refined tastes, inclined to be neat
in personal appearance, for he went to Frank&#8217;s
bathroom to clean up. There he used the washbowl
and the toilet articles, leaving black hair
turning gray in the comb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is uncanny,&#8221; shouted Frank. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t have observed all this during the minute
you were in the bathroom,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw considered the question gravely,
his eyes fixed on those of the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sprinkled the closet floor, did he?&#8221;
he asked, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; and stood back against the closet
wall, and used Frank&#8217;s comb and brush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he come to this room, also?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; the little round spots on the delicate
covering of this little table were made by
dripping water. You see, sir, he was in here
before the water dripped off his clothes in the
closet, probably soon after he entered the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did he get into the house? How
did he get into this locked room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say that he was assisted by some
one belonging in the house,&#8221; was the quiet reply.
&#8220;After he left this room he mounted the staircase
and hid in Frank&#8217;s closet, evidently waiting
for you to return home, or for Frank to come.
Perhaps he hoped that one of you might bring
home the thing, or the things, he had been unable
to find in your rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers concerning the Gatun plot, for
instance,&#8221; said the lieutenant.</p>
<p>The editor glanced at the officer with a slight
frown on his brow, but made no reply to the
remark. It was plain that he was unwilling to
take up that phase of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonder the fellow didn&#8217;t jimmy
Frank&#8217;s safe and get the emerald necklace, without
waiting so long for the safe to be opened,&#8221;
he said, in a moment.</p>
<p>Thus insisting on his previously expressed
opinion that the sole purpose of the thieves had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
been to secure the emerald necklace, further
disclaiming any belief that the alleged plot
against the government had figured in the matter
at all, the editor smiled provokingly at the
officer.</p>
<p>Nestor looked from the lieutenant to the
newspaper owner and smiled quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whether the papers
we hear so much about really reveal the
details of an alleged plot against the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do not,&#8221; continued the boy, &#8220;do
they connect some man, or some group of men,
with a plot which may be forming?&#8221;</p>
<p>The editor glanced approvingly at Ned, as if
rather pleased with his cleverness, but did not
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known newspaper men,&#8221; Ned went
on, &#8220;to make mistakes in such matters. However,
I have no doubt that you have good reasons
for the course you are taking,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and therefore I have no fault to find
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine fellow, Mr. Nestor,&#8221; the editor
exclaimed. &#8220;Some day, when you see the
matter in the right light, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
I can&#8217;t do so now, for no end of trouble might
come from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;There is one
more question I want to ask you. Will you
answer it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can consistently do so, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the men who searched this house to-night
were after the necklace, and that alone,
why should they extend their operations to
your offices in the newspaper building?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they do that?&#8221; asked the editor calmly.
&#8220;Then I shall have to go down there and look
things over. Will you kindly accompany me?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the search at the offices was barren of
clues.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>AT THE GREAT GATUN DAM.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Over there is the oldest country on this side
of the world,&#8221; said Peter Fenton, pointing over
the rail of the vessel and across the smooth
waters of the Caribbean sea. &#8220;We are now on
the famous Spanish Main,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;where
adventurers from the Windward Islands laid in
wait for the galleons of Spain. Just ahead,
rising out of the sea, is the Isthmus of Panama.
Down there to the left is the continent of South
America, where there were cathedrals and palaces
when Manhattan Island was still populated
by native Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minds of the Boy Scouts were filled with
splendid dreams as they followed with their eyes
the directions indicated by the pointing hand.
It was all a fairyland to them. Peter talked for
some time on the causes which had brought the
scum of the seven seas to the Isthmus, and then
Ned Nestor interrupted the talk by inviting
them all to the stateroom he occupied in common
with Frank Shaw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>When all were seated on chairs and bunks
Ned opened the door and looked out on the
passage which ran along in front of the apartment.
When he turned back into the room
there was a humorous twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Nobbs is in sight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same party?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same dusky gentleman who has followed
us since the night of the theft of the
emerald necklace,&#8221; Ned replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to receive a Carnegie medal for
always being on the spot,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to turn the hose on him,&#8221; Jimmie
corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should feel lost without him,&#8221; laughed
George Tolford. &#8220;When I first saw him in the
newspaper building, while you were investigating
the chaos of papers in Mr. Shaw&#8217;s rooms,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;I had a hunch that we shouldn&#8217;t
be able to lose him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we haven&#8217;t been able to lose him,&#8221;
Peter Fenton said. &#8220;He reminds me, the way
he floats about, of the ghost of some pirate who
sailed about the Spanish Main four hundred
years ago in a long, low, rakish craft adorned
with a black flag.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him in the newspaper building that
night,&#8221; Jimmie said, &#8220;an&#8217; he looked glad because
we got no clues there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Ned have him arrested in New
York?&#8221; asked Jack Bosworth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; demanded Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;For making a nuisance of himself. Then he
couldn&#8217;t have followed us on board the ship.
Also, he might have been able to get a little
sleep nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we have kept him going,&#8221; Frank
observed, with a laugh.</p>
<p>Ever since the night of the robbery the man
called &#8220;His Nobbs&#8221; for want of a better name
had kept Ned Nestor in sight most of the time.
He had followed him home after the profitless
visit to the newspaper office on the night of the
theft, had chased about after him while the details
of the trip to Panama were arranged the
next day, and had turned up on the ship after
she was under way.</p>
<p>The fellow did not seem to be overly anxious
to keep his watchfulness a secret. He acted
like any first cabin passenger on the ship. But,
somehow, he managed to keep Ned in view most
of the time. Now and then he was caught
watching the door of Ned&#8217;s stateroom. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
never spoke to the boy, and never even looked at
him when the two passed one another.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this preference for
Ned&#8217;s company, the boys had put up all sorts
of jobs on the fellow, and some of their pranks
had kept him watching Ned&#8217;s odd moves all
night. It was a new and strange experience to
Ned, this being spied upon so openly, and he was
at a loss to account for the mental processes
which inspired the strange surveillance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ned presently, &#8220;let him watch
outside if he wants to. We came in here to talk
about something else. I have just been talking
with Lieutenant Gordon, and he says we are
to go into camp in the jungle not far from the
Gatun dam. He will stop at the Tivoli, at
Ancon, adjoining Panama. When we have
anything to communicate to him, one of us can
go down to Panama after supplies and leave word
at an office where one of the lieutenant&#8217;s associates
in the case will always be in waiting. We
are not to know the lieutenant if we meet him
in our soup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be eaten alive out there in the jungle,&#8221;
protested Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, it would be more natural for us to
go to Gatun for our supplies,&#8221; Peter Fenton said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are reasons why he wants us to remain
in the jungle near Gatun for a time,&#8221; Ned
replied, and the boys separated, Jimmie strolling
off in the wake of &#8220;His Nobbs,&#8221; &#8220;just to see if he
couldn&#8217;t make him cough up something,&#8221; as
he expressed it.</p>
<p>The mystery of the theft of the emerald necklace
was still unsolved, the man whose picture
Ned carried in his brain had not been found,
Pedro had been among the missing ever since
he had walked out of the Shaw residence on the
morning after the robbery. When the boys
landed at Colon the next morning the case upon
which they were engaged was still new ground
before them.</p>
<p>Frank Shaw continued to take the loss of
his emeralds very seriously, and at no time during
the trip to Colon had he failed to keep an
eye out for Pedro, whom he suspected of having
admitted the thief to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name isn&#8217;t Pedro at all,&#8221; he said, as the
train sped out of the network of tracks behind
Colon, &#8220;but Pedrarias. That was the name of
the robber who succeeded Balboa as governor
of New Granada, the pirate who stood Balboa
up against a wall and shot him. Pedro, as I
call him for short, declares that he is a direct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
descendant of that old stiff. He says the Spanish
blood in his veins is pure. Great Scott! if I
had such a pirate for an ancestor, I&#8217;d keep
mighty still about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Fenton was in his element now. As
the train moved away from Colon he pointed out
various points of interest, and supplied such
information about them as he had gleaned from
the maps and books he had consulted. The
ruins of the old French workings were soon in
sight, the locality where millions had been
squandered in graft. And there was Mount
Hope Cemetery, where thousands who had perished
from fever had been buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctors have cleaned out the fever
now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by cleaning out the mosquitoes&mdash;the
poison kind with the long name,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;The Canal Zone is about as healthy now as the
city of New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then came thickets where the trees were
tied together with vines and creepers, all in
gorgeous bloom. The great trees lifting their
heads out of the jungle reminded the boys of the
electric towers of New York, the twists of vines
resembling the mighty cables which convey light,
heat and power to the inhabitants of Manhattan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>As if in rivalry of the wealth of blossoms,
bright-plumaged birds darted about like butterflies
of unnatural growth. Now and then
they saw evil looking lizards, some of them a
yard in length, scuttling off through the marshes
or looking down from high limbs. There was a
swampy atmosphere over all the landscape.</p>
<p>Then, as the Boy Scouts looked, thinking of
the glory of a camp in the thicket&mdash;of a retired
nook on some dry knoll&mdash;the jungle disappeared
as if by magic, and the train was winding up
grassy hills. Beyond, higher up, the scattered
houses of a city of fair size came into view.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Gatun,&#8221; cried Fenton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read
half a dozen descriptions of it lately. Great
town, that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The houses look like boxes from here,&#8221;
Jimmie observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Peter replied, &#8220;they are all
two-story houses, square, with double balconies
all screened in. Might be Philadelphia, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were smooth roads in front of the
houses, and there were yards where flowers were
growing, and where neatly dressed children were
playing. Jimmie turned from the homelike
scene to Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought there would be something new
down here,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;This is just like a
town up the Hudson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie expected to find people living in
tents made out of animal skins,&#8221; laughed
George. &#8220;He thinks the natives eat folks alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait until you get out of the country,&#8221;
Frank said, &#8220;before you talk of cottages up the
Hudson. There will be something stirring before
we get off the Isthmus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Jimmie replied. &#8220;There surely
will be if we camp back there in the jungle,
among the snakes and lizards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not camp on the hills back there?&#8221;
asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may soon camp anywhere we like,&#8221;
said Ned. &#8220;The Zone government understands
that we are a lot of kids out after specimens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Specimens of what?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tall, slender men with black hair turning
gray,&#8221; replied Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit your kiddin&#8217;,&#8221; grinned Jimmie.</p>
<p>The boys left the train at a modern depot,
passed through the train-shed, crossed a level
sward, and looked down into a mighty chasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; cried Frank. &#8220;Is that the
bottom of the world?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>He pointed below as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be a thin crust of rock between
the bottom and the other side of the
world,&#8221; laughed George. &#8220;See! There are
tunnels and pits down there. The men are still
digging. Look like ants, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a wonderful sight, and the Boy Scouts
gazed long at the scene of activity before turning
away toward the Gatun dam itself. This, Peter
Fenton explained, was one of the big cuts of the
canal, and ran from the marshy valley above
down through the rocky ridge which held the
rains in check and made a swamp of the upland.</p>
<p>Along the margins of the excavation ran
shining steel rails upon which were mounted
tapering structures of steel, from which cables
crossed the gorge, carrying great buckets of
concrete for the work below. Heavy walls were
growing out of the depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ships will come up out of the sea
through this cut,&#8221; Peter explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;ll climb the hill,&#8221; scorned Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will stop down there,&#8221; said Peter,
&#8220;and the lock gates will be closed, and the water
will lift them to the level of the lake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see no lake,&#8221; observed the skeptical
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lake will lie where the low land is, over
there,&#8221; replied Peter, pointing. &#8220;The Gatun
dam will block the water and make a lake 85
feet above sea level, covering one hundred and
sixty-four square miles of earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the most of the canal will be lake?&#8221;
asked the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a lot of it,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if any one should blow up the dam,
after it gets on its job, the ships would have to
climb a ladder if they got over to Panama,&#8221; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that,&#8221; Peter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the Gatun dam?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is going up over there,&#8221; Peter replied,
pointing out a low, broad ridge which appeared
to link two hills together. &#8220;That is what will
make the inland sea, and that is the lump of earth
we came here to look after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a busy place night and day,&#8221; Ned said.
&#8220;See the electric towers and wires? Work never
stops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like His Nobbs,&#8221; grinned Jimmie.
&#8220;I wonder if he has had any sleep since
he struck our trail?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him since we left the train,&#8221;
Jack said. &#8220;Perhaps he has delivered us over to
the Panama division of the Anti-Canal Benevolent
Society. In that case, we shall see no more
of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a time the boys strolled over to a neat
little hotel on the principal street of the town,
and there saw Lieutenant Gordon, who strolled
up to Ned, just as any two Americans meeting
there might have affiliated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your camp in the jungle is ready for you,&#8221;
the officer said, as the two walked about the
lobby of the hotel. &#8220;You will find a movable
cottage there, all furnished, and a good cook.
Until further orders you are all to remain there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty quick work,&#8221; said Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The orders for the cottage camp were sent
over by wire before we left New York,&#8221; the lieutenant
replied. &#8220;You are at liberty to roam
about the works at will, only you ought to leave
some one at the cottage always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I understand it, we are boys looking for
adventure?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And an emerald necklace,&#8221; added the boy
with a laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have a notion that if you find Pedro you
will find the necklace, unless you find him too
late&mdash;after he has disposed of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; Ned replied, doubtingly,
&#8220;but we are not likely to run across Pedro over
here. Neither shall we see His Nobbs. They
have played their roles, and we shall have new
ones to contend with now.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night the boys took possession of the
cottage in the jungle, dancing and prancing
about it like wild Indians. It all seemed to
them to be too good to be true. Here they were,
at last, on the Canal Zone, and, in a way, in the
secret service of the government. It was late
when they retired, and no guard was set.</p>
<p>This Ned regretted, after the others were
asleep, and so lay awake a long time, watching.
Then, about midnight, he saw some one looking
in at the porch door.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>A BOMB AND A RUINED TEMPLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Ned lay perfectly still and the door was
closed again, with the figure still on the outside.
There were no lights inside the cottage, and it
was a fairly clear night, so the boy could see the
man standing on the porch, the wire screen in the
door robbing his figure of sharp outline.</p>
<p>The intruder appeared to be listening for
some sound within. Now and then he bent his
head forward toward the door, and once, when
Jimmie snorted out in his sleep, he darted a
hand toward his hip, as if reaching for a weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Nobbs, or his substitute, has arrived,&#8221;
thought Ned.</p>
<p>After a moment the man left the porch, closing
the outer door carefully behind him. Ned
was out of bed in an instant, following on after
him. When he gained the porch, the intruder
was turning the corner of the house.</p>
<p>Fearful of being seen, Ned crouched in a dark
corner of the porch and waited. He could hear
the fellow moving about, but could not see him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
as he kept away from the front of the cottage.</p>
<p>The situation did not change for five minutes.
The unwelcome visitor was still moving about
outside and Ned was waiting for some decisive
move to be made. The cottage did not rest on
the knoll itself, but was set up on blocks a foot or
more in height, and before long the boy heard
sounds which indicated that the man he was
watching was creeping in under the floor.</p>
<p>Waiting only long enough to make sure of
this, Ned left the porch and hid himself in the
jungle, which, on the south, came to within a few
feet of the wall. The fellow was indeed under
the house, as the boy knew by the sounds he
made. It was perfectly dark under there, so
his movements could not be observed.</p>
<p>In five minutes more the fellow backed out
and arose to his feet. Then Ned saw that he
held something in his right hand which looked
like a fuse. It seemed that it was the man&#8217;s
benevolent idea to deprive the jungle of the
society of the boys by blowing up their cottage.</p>
<p>Ned&#8217;s first impulse was to shoot the fellow
where he stood. He had no doubt that the
fellow had put enough explosive under the floor
to kill every person in it. That would be murder,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
and the boy&#8217;s impulse was to deal out to the
ruffian the fate of a murderer.</p>
<p>But he did not fire, for the intruder had not
yet lighted the fuse. He stood for a moment
with the end in his hand and then moved toward
that part of the jungle where Ned was concealed.
The boy moved cautiously aside, but even then,
as the man crouched down in the vines, he could
have touched him with a hand by crawling a
yard to the front.</p>
<p>Deliberately the fellow lighted a match and
applied it to the fuse. The end of the cord
brightened for an instant and then became black
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were whispered in English.</p>
<p>He struck another match, listened an instant
to make sure that the noise of the lighting had
not attracted attention inside the cottage, and
applied it to the fuse. The fuse burned swiftly,
and the boy heard the incendiary go crashing
through the tangle of vines and creepers, heading
toward the south.</p>
<p>Ned cut the fuse above the crawling coal and
stood for a moment listening to the man struggling
with the undergrowth. Then he hastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
into the cottage and laid a hand on Frank
Shaw&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;The fireworks
have begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank sat up in his bunk and rubbed his
eyes sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Have you found
the necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress, quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder you wouldn&#8217;t let a fellow sleep,&#8221;
grumbled Frank.</p>
<p>While the boys were dressing there came a
snicker from Jimmie&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t start anythin&#8217; you can&#8217;t stop,&#8221; they
heard the boy whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want a midnight ramble among the
snakes?&#8221; asked Ned, drawing on a pair of rubber
boots which came up to his thighs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I do,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then get up and dress, and put on your
high boots, for there are crawling things in the
jungle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the boys dressing, Ned hastened
outside and listened. The man who had attempted
the destruction of the cottage was still
moving through the thicket. It seemed to Ned
that an army could have made no more noise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
than he made. In a moment he was joined by
Frank and Jimmie.</p>
<p>In as few words as possible Ned explained
the situation to his amazed chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to follow that fellow to his principal,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;I want to know who set
him at such cowardly work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be difficult to follow him,&#8221; Frank
said. &#8220;He makes a noise like a circus parade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of you must stay here and watch the
cottage,&#8221; Ned said, then. &#8220;When the explosion
does not come, he may circle back here to
see what has happened. The other may go with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both boys insisted on accompanying Ned,
but it was finally decided that it would be better
policy to leave Frank at the cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to make haste,&#8221; Frank said,
regretfully, &#8220;for the sounds he is making are
becoming fainter. What are you going to do
with that fuse?&#8221; he added, as Ned drew on the
line and hauled about half a foot of gas pipe from
under the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do no harm to take it with me,&#8221;
Ned replied. &#8220;It is not very heavy to carry,
and it may be of use.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll blow that chap up with it,&#8221;
exclaimed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful that you don&#8217;t blow yourself up
with it,&#8221; warned Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no cigarette smokers in the party,
and so there is no danger,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here listening when the explosion
comes,&#8221; grinned Frank.</p>
<p>The sounds out in the jungle were now growing
fainter. The man was either finding the
way easier or he was getting some distance away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Jimmie urged. &#8220;He&#8217;ll get away
from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you make as much noise as he does,&#8221;
Frank said, &#8220;he&#8217;ll stop and shoot you before
you get anywhere near him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no part of Ned&#8217;s intention, however,
to follow the intruder through the jungle. He
was now waiting to make sure of the general
direction the fellow was taking. He listened
some moments longer, until the sounds grew
very faint indeed, and then took the path which
led from the cottage to a fairly well-made road
ending five miles away at one of the streets of
Gatun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; the wrong steer,&#8221; Jimmie
said, as they moved along. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
around the world if you catch him by going this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow is making for the hills,&#8221; explained
Ned, &#8220;and we may be able to catch him
as he comes out of the jungle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys made good speed along the cleared
lane until they came to a rolling, grassy hill, one
of many leading up to the summit. Then they
turned off to the east, still keeping their pace
but taking precautions against being seen, as the
night was clearer now than before, and a moon
looked down from the sky.</p>
<p>Finally Ned paused in a little valley on a
gentle slope.</p>
<p>It was one of the wonderful nights rarely
experienced save under the equator, or very close
to the middle girdle of the globe. The luxuriant
growths of the jungle seemed to be breathing
in long, steady pulsations, so uniform was
the lifting and falling of the night breeze.</p>
<p>Now and then the call of a night bird or the
cry of a wild animal in the thickets came through
the heavy air. From the distance came the
clamor of the greatest work the world has ever
undertaken. The thud and creaking of machinery
mingled with the primitive noises of the
forest. And far away over the cut flared the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
white light of the great electric globes which
lighted the workers on their tasks.</p>
<p>As the boys looked forth from their depression
in the side of the slope, two men came
around the rise of the hill and stood at the edge
of the jungle, not more than half a dozen yards
away. Almost at the same instant it became
apparent that some one was floundering about in
the thicket immediately in front of them.</p>
<p>A low whistle cut the air, and then the creepers
parted and a man&#8217;s head and shoulders appeared.
Ned and Jimmie crouched lower in
their dent in the grassy hill.</p>
<p>The man emerged from the thicket and stood
with the others, tearing clinging vines and leaves
from his clothing as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is wrong?&#8221; a voice asked. &#8220;There
has been no explosion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fuse was wet,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you go back and fix it?&#8221;
demanded the first speaker. &#8220;The sooner the
job is done the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some one stirring in the jungle,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice man to be given such a task,&#8221; roared
another voice. &#8220;You must go back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve landed the plotters, all right,&#8221;
whispered Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet there&#8217;s plenty more
bombs like the one you have, waiting to be
tucked under the Gatun dam. Gee! I&#8217;d like to
take a shot at them gazabos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still standing in the moonlight, only a short
distance from the listening boys, the three men
argued in low tones for a moment. It was clear
that the man who had placed the bomb was refusing
to obey the orders given by the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in love with the job, anyway,&#8221; the
fellow snarled, &#8220;and you may do it yourselves
if you want it done to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others did not appear to relish the murderous
job they were urging the speaker to undertake,
and in a few moments the party moved
around the base of the hill and then struck for
the higher ground by way of a gully which cut
between two elevations.</p>
<p>When the boys, mounting the breast of the
hill and crouching at the summit, saw the men
again, two were making for the cloud of light
which lay over the workings while the other was
following the crest of the hill toward the east.</p>
<p>Presently the two swung down into a valley,
and then twin lights like those of a great touring
car showed over a rise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
&#8220;There must be a good road there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car came on a few yards after the lamp
showed, and the two men clambered aboard.
In five minutes the motor car was speeding
toward Gatun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two for the city and one for the tall timber,&#8221;
Jimmie snickered, as the car moved out of
view. &#8220;There&#8217;s the solitary individual watching
them from the summit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boy spoke the man who had laid the
bomb so unsuccessfully faced away to the east
and disappeared down the slope. It was not
difficult to keep track of him, although the
necessity for concealment was imperative, and
the fellow proceeded at a swift pace for an hour.</p>
<p>At the end of that time he was in a lonely section
of country, where rounded knolls were surrounded
by the dense growth of the jungle. In
spite of the wildness of the spot, however, Ned
saw that civilization had at some distant time
made its mark there. Here and there low,
broken walls of brick lifted from the grass, and
the vegetation was not quite so luxuriant. In
numerous places, as they advanced, the boys
saw that the ground had once been leveled off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
as if to make way for a building, the ruins of
which were still to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the ruined cities of the Isthmus,&#8221;
Jimmie whispered. &#8220;If Peter could see this he
would know all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a very large city,&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the ruins of a temple over there,&#8221;
insisted the boy. &#8220;There&#8217;s a wall standing yet.
And there&#8217;s the man we want going into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boy spoke the man they were following
disappeared behind the wall. Before he
could be restrained Jimmie wiggled forward to
the foot of the ruin. Nestor saw him peering
around the end of the line of brick and hastened
forward.</p>
<p>The man they had followed was nowhere in
sight when Ned turned the angle, and Jimmie lay
on the ground in the shadows, kicking up his
heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went down through the earth,&#8221; the
boy giggled, regardless of the danger of the
situation. &#8220;He went right down through the
ground. Say, but he&#8217;s a corker, to get out of
sight like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned caught the lad by the arm, to silence
him, and listened. A steady click-click came
from the ground beneath their feet. The sounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
came continuously, almost with the regularity
of the ticking of a clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was he when he disappeared?&#8221;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there in the corner,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;He walked up to the wall and stepped out of
sight. What&#8217;s that queer smell?&#8221; he added,
sniffing the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be a fire down there in the vaults
of the old temple,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;They must
have a fire, for the smoke is coming out of a
crevice at the top of that wall, and they are
working on metal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jimmie, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;re
makin&#8217; more bombs&mdash;bombs for the dam.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>WORKING ON NED&#8217;S THEORY.</h3>
</div>

<p>At daybreak Frank Shaw stood in the
screened porch facing west, watching and waiting
for the return of Nestor and Jimmie. It had
been a long night for him, but he had kept his
vigil alone, knowing that his chums needed all
the rest they could get.</p>
<p>Many times between midnight and morning
the noises of the tropical forest had taken on the
semblance of human voices, and then he had
crept out from the screens to listen intently for
some indication of the approach of his friends.
But they had not come, and now he was anxious
to set out in search of them.</p>
<p>While he stood there with his brain filled
with forebodings of evil, he heard a step in the
cottage, and then Jack Bosworth stood by his
side, bright and exuberant of spirit after his long
sleep. He stood silent for a moment, looking
out into the wonderful jungle and then turned to
Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Great country,&#8221; he exclaimed, sweeping a
hand toward the gorgeous thickets.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dangerous country,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a country for an appetite,&#8221; cried Jack.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the boys up and we&#8217;ll have breakfast.
Why,&#8221; he added, turning back to the porch after
glancing over the row of bunks, &#8220;where&#8217;s Ned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went away at midnight,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;and hasn&#8217;t returned. I&#8217;m afraid something
serious has happened to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have been watching for him all
night?&#8221; asked Jack. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you waken
me? I reckon I&#8217;m entitled to a fair share of
what&#8217;s going on here, be it good or bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank told the story of the night briefly
and Jack listened with a frown on his brow.
His fingers clenched at mention of the bomb
which had been placed under the floor of the
cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re spotted, of course,&#8221; he said, when
Frank concluded the story. &#8220;If we had only
tipped His Nobbs off the ship on the way over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suggested that to Ned,&#8221; Frank answered,
&#8220;but he only laughed at me. He declared the
fellow to be the missing link between himself
and the principals in the Gatun dam plot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221; demanded Jack, with
a puzzled air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is his theory that half of the criminals
of the world would escape punishment if
they could only learn to lie quiet until they were
looked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. His notion was that the plotters,
guided by His Nobbs, would visit us with hostile
intentions, and that they might leave a trail
back to their own camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they seem to have looked us up all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other boys now came tumbling out of
the cottage, shouting their greetings to Frank
and Jack and the golden morning, and clamoring
for breakfast. Five minutes later, when the
events of the night had been explained, their
healthy appetites had vanished. Even when
the cook began preparations for the morning
meal, filling the air with tantalizing odors of
cooking food, they sat in serious consultation
with no thought of breakfast in their minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ought we to do?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and look him up,&#8221; suggested George
Tolford.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He may have become lost in the jungle,&#8221;
Peter Fenton remarked. &#8220;Suppose we go out
into the jungle and fire our guns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is worse than that,&#8221; Glen
Howard remarked. &#8220;We ought to let Lieutenant
Gordon know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid Ned wouldn&#8217;t like that,&#8221;
Frank said.</p>
<p>While the boys discussed ways and means a
dusky youth of perhaps twenty was seen approaching
the cottage on a run. His dress was
half American and half native, but his face was
wholly Spanish. He paused when he discovered
the boys on the porch and held out his hands, as
if to show that his mission was a peaceful one.
Frank motioned to him to approach and opened
the screened porch door for him to enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, in
excellent English. &#8220;I am from Lieutenant
Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think you&#8217;re the fellow we are looking
for,&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants you to join him up at the Culebra
cut,&#8221; the youngster continued. &#8220;The two who
left the cottage last night are there waiting for
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; shouted Jack. &#8220;We were just
wondering what had become of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wandered out to Gatun and came
upon the lieutenant,&#8221; said the messenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the night?&#8221; asked Peter, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while before daybreak,&#8221; was the
ready reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go and get ready for the journey,&#8221;
Frank said, but at the door he beckoned to Jack
and they walked away together.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he seems to be all right,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;At any rate he knows about the boys
going away in the night and not coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man they followed away would know
that, too,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>Jack looked his friend in the face for a moment
and scratched his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;do you think this is a
stall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of the fellow,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Besides, what would the boys be doing
up at the Culebra cut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think it is crooked we won&#8217;t go,&#8221;
Jack observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another thing,&#8221; Frank went on, &#8220;we were
to have nothing to do with Lieutenant Gordon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
while on the Isthmus. We were to roam about
at our own sweet will and pick up what information
we could. So it doesn&#8217;t seem likely that he
would send for us all to meet him at the Culebra
cut. Does it, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t look reasonable,&#8221; Jack admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what we were saying about Ned&#8217;s
theory?&#8221; Frank asked, in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean our talk about criminals pointing
the way to their own destruction by unwise
activity in defensive methods? Of course I
remember it. If what we suspect is true, though,
Ned rather overplayed it in this case, and got
caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know yet whether he got caught
or not. We only know that he is unaccountably
missing. Well, what if we accept Ned&#8217;s theory
here and go with this messenger? If he is on the
square he&#8217;ll take us to Ned. If he is crooked
he&#8217;ll take us to people who know why Ned did
not return to the cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be easier to get taken to the people
you speak of than to get away from them,&#8221;
Jack said, dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m game to try it, anyway,&#8221; Frank continued,
&#8220;but I think we ought to leave one behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
at the cottage, for Ned may return, possibly,
though I doubt it. Anyway, it will do no
harm to leave some one here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; suggested Jack, &#8220;we don&#8217;t leave
any one at the cottage, but instruct one of the
boys to remain here when we go with this fellow
and then follow on immediately, sort of keep
track of where we are taken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine idea,&#8221; Frank replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go with the messenger and take the boys with
me. You remain here and see where we go&mdash;that
is, you remain here when we leave and then
trail on after us, like a Sherlock Holmes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather go with you,&#8221; Jack replied,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll do the sleuth act if you prefer to have
me. You&#8217;ll need a rescuer, all right,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;for Lieutenant Gordon never sent that chap
after us. Never in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cook soon called the boys to breakfast,
but there was not much eaten, greatly to the
disgust of the cook. When they left the table
the messenger asked if they were ready to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; cried Frank, but Jack threw
himself into a chair and took up a magazine,
watching the face of the messenger over the
pages as he did so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are to give up the cottage,&#8221; the messenger
said, with a frown of disapproval. &#8220;No
one is to be left here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be all right for me to remain here
until the others come,&#8221; Jack said, with a smile.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like a walk this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a motor car just over the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No inducement,&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The messenger said no more, though it was
plain that the arrangement did not please him.
In a few moments the boys were off, the messenger
leading the way and keeping up a running fire
of conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; asked Jack of
the cook, as the party disappeared in the thicket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I overheard
what Frank told you about the disappearance
of Ned and Jimmie, and was anticipating
something of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not for me to interfere,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>The cook, known as Tommy, was looked over
critically by Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re all to the good,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be here if you wasn&#8217;t. Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
what do you say to exchanging clothes with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no objections, only I don&#8217;t exactly
see&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just about the same size,&#8221; Jack went
on. &#8220;Same black hair and black eyes, same
ugly smooth face&mdash;glad you have no whiskers.
You&#8217;re tanned up a little, but I can put some
stain on my face. There you are. The cook
goes to Gatun and Culebra and Jack Bosworth
remains at the cottage. They won&#8217;t think of
molesting the cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But some one ought to remain here,&#8221; urged
Jack.</p>
<p>Tommy thought over the proposition for a
moment and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll remain here, as
long as necessary,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The exchange of clothing was quickly made
and Jack managed to darken his face with a stain
made of crushed leaves which Tommy gathered
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;ll stay right here, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Jack asked, as he passed out of the doorway.
&#8220;Ned and Jimmie may return, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll stay right here,&#8221; the cook said
with a grin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>But as Jack entered the thicket he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you get out of sight. Then it is me
for the Tivoli and Lieutenant Gordon. It looks
to me as if these babes in the woods had bitten
off more than they can chew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether his supposition was right or wrong,
the cottage was closed in five minutes, and Tommy,
wearing Jack&#8217;s clothing, was racing through
the path Ned had taken the night before, on his
way to Lieutenant Gordon.</p>
<p>His journey on foot, however, was destined
to be a short one, for at the turn of the path he
came upon a man loitering in the open space just
ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a second,&#8221; the man exclaimed.</p>
<p>Tommy was not inclined to check his pace,
but a revolver in the hands of the fellow induced
him to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Jack Bosworth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy hesitated. For an instant he thought
of declaring his identity and so getting away to
the Tivoli and Lieutenant Gordon. The man
in his path settled the problem for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use to deny it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are to
come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Tommy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you have any weapons give them to me,&#8221;
the other said, gruffly, paying no attention to
the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Tommy said, handing out a
revolver. &#8220;It is a heavy thing to carry, anyway.
Where are you going to take me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight ahead,&#8221; cried the captor, with a
frown. &#8220;Straight ahead. I&#8217;ll tell you when to
turn and when to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have an accommodating disposition,&#8221;
laughed Tommy. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you
stop the cook, who went out a little while ago?
Perhaps he would have been glad of your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not interested in the cook,&#8221; came
the answer, and Tommy smiled as he thought
that at least one point of the ruse had met with
success.</p>
<p>&#8220;That cook will be fired for leaving the cottage,&#8221;
grinned Tommy, making the deception as
complete as possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime the motor car containing
the five boys and the messenger was speeding
on its way toward Gatun and the Culebra cut.
When Jack came out on the road the machine
was disappearing from sight, but he managed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
keep track of it from the hilltops for a considerable
distance.</p>
<p>The messenger was full of talk, his evident
intention being to keep the boys interested.
In spite of the attention paid them, however,
Frank and Harry Stevens managed to hold a
conversation on the back seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is carrying out Ned&#8217;s theory with a
vengeance,&#8221; Harry remarked. &#8220;If we get
dumped into the big cut we&#8217;ll charge it up to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The play opens with plenty of action in the
first scene,&#8221; grinned Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adventure would look better to me if I
knew what had become of Ned and Jimmie,&#8221;
Harry said, despondently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we keep up the appearance of being
pleased with the ride,&#8221; Frank said, &#8220;we may be
able to learn something of their whereabouts.
It is mystery to me how the plotters got hold
of Ned, if they did get hold of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You recall the talk in New York as to
whether the men who entered Mr. Shaw&#8217;s study
were in quest of the plot papers or the emerald
necklace?&#8221; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and I&#8217;ve been studying over that problem
ever since.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been wondering, ever since we
started out on this rather risky trip with the
messenger, whether the people Ned encountered
last night, and the people we are likely to meet
to-day, are the people of the plot papers or the
people of the emerald necklace. What do you
think about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see why the necklace thieves should
bother. They&#8217;ve got the trinket they wanted,
haven&#8217;t they? It is the canal blowers we are
facing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Ned&#8217;s theory,&#8221; whispered Harry.
&#8220;Well, if the necklace thieves have brought the
bauble back to the Isthmus, they think we&#8217;re
hot after them, and so may strike at us before
we can get our guard up. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to believe they brought the necklace over
here, though. Then I might stand a chance to
get it back. You&#8217;ll find that it is the men who
are plotting against the big dam that we are
mixing with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The motor car ran through Gatun without
stopping, and finally drew up at a rambling old
structure which seemed to have been deserted
ever since the days of Balboa. The messenger
explained that they were to wait there for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
lieutenant, and all entered the ancient ruin, the
boys looking carefully about as they stepped
through the doorway.</p>
<p>The room which first received them was long
and narrow, with walls showing both age and
neglect. They were met at the door by a tall
gentleman of military bearing and a dwarf whose
mischievous black eyes stared fixedly into their
faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lieutenant is late,&#8221; the military man
explained. &#8220;If one of you is Frank Shaw, however,
a portion of the business of the day may be
taken up before his arrival.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank admitted his identity, and was invited
into a smaller room opening from the apartment
in which the others waited.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>EXPLOSIVES FOR THE GATUN DAM.</h3>
</div>

<p>Ned and Jimmie listened for some moments
to the steady click-click of metal which came,
or appeared to come, from the ground directly
underneath their feet, and then Ned arose and
crept forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;?&#8221; whispered Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned pointed to the dark corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come away,&#8221; warned the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here to investigate,&#8221; Ned replied,
almost impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then investigate with a bomb, or with a
cannon,&#8221; advised Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No time for that,&#8221; came the reply. &#8220;The
conditions which exist now may not exist in an
hour&#8217;s time. It is now or never.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving forward, Ned saw a faint finger of
light cutting the shadows in the corner Jimmie
had pointed out. Jimmie saw it at the same
instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;ve got a blacksmith shop down
there,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>There was no opening in the great stone slabs
of the floor through which a man might make his
way&mdash;only the crevice through which the ray of
light came. Ned turned his attention to the
wall to the south.</p>
<p>Behind a luxuriant growth of vines he saw
another glimmer of light, and in a moment stood
looking down a narrow stairway, at the distant
end of which were numerous lines of red flame.
Jimmie, looking over Ned&#8217;s shoulder, uttered a
muffled exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a door made out of red-hot bars,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a board door,&#8221; Ned whispered back,
&#8220;with wide cracks between the planks. There
is an intense red fire in the room beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned placed a foot on the top step of the stairway
and slowly and cautiously rested the weight
of his body upon it, to make certain that no trap
for the protection of the place had been set there.
The stone step was solid and bore his weight
firmly.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairway the boys
stopped and looked about. Straight ahead was
the cracked door, to the south was a solid wall,
to the north, under the stone pavement they had
crossed to gain the corner, was a dark room, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
door to which stood open. The room was close
and hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are your matches, Jimmie?&#8221; whispered
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a pocketful,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Want
a light?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. We would better feel our way
into the room. Keep close to me and keep your
gun handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room was small, something like a vestibule
to a larger one which ran along parallel
with the one from which the light came. It was
very dark there, and more than once the boys
stumbled over obstructions on the floor, which
seemed to be of brick or stone. Once Ned
heard Jimmie laughing softly as he rolled on the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; what the movin&#8217; picture men
are missin&#8217;,&#8221; the boy said, as he moved forward
on his hands and knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would look rather amusing&mdash;on a
white canvas on the Bowery,&#8221; Ned said.</p>
<p>After reaching a wall, the stones of which felt
damp and oozy to the touch, Ned ventured to
light a match. The underground room was long
and narrow, with rock walls in which there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
no opening except the one by way of which the
boys had entered.</p>
<p>Ned, by the flaring light of the match,
brushed away the mould which flourished in that
unwholesome place and seated himself on the
stone floor, his back against the wall. Jimmie,
seeking physical companionship, nestled close
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; the little fellow remarked, with a
snicker, &#8220;you thinkin&#8217; of takin&#8217; up a homestead
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to remain in this room until the
workers in the other chamber go away,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a notion to look into that
apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if they don&#8217;t go away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait until they do. It is probable that
they do all their work at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t have to wait long,&#8221; the boy
replied. &#8220;It was growing light in the east when
we came down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie dropped off into a restless sleep after
a time, and Ned sat there waiting and listening,
just as Frank, a short time later, waited and
listened on the porch of the cottage in the jungle.
When the boy awoke it was with a start of anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The boys will think we&#8217;re dead,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they won&#8217;t try to follow us,&#8221; Ned
whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do,&#8221; the other said, &#8220;they&#8217;ll find
signs in twigs and stones all the way along.
The stone heaps point the way to this place, and
give the warning at the place where the stairs
begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reference was here made to Boy Scout
methods used in the forest. For instance, a
stone with a smaller one on top says:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Place a stone to the right of this and the
meaning is:</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>One to the left means:</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smaller stone on top of the other two, with
none at the side, means: &#8220;Be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they will keep away,&#8221; Ned went on.
&#8220;It is a miracle, almost, that we got in here
without being discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you think you&#8217;ll find in there?&#8221; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something concerning the plot,&#8221; was the
reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>It seemed a long time before the work in the
chamber ceased, and Ned had plenty of time in
which to review the strange case he was interested
in. The transition from gay New York to
that weird apartment seemed almost like a whiff
of fancy. Then he recalled the painstaking surveillance
of the fellow called &#8220;His Nobbs&#8221; on the
way down, and smiled at the thought that the
plans he had made at first sight of the spy had
worked out remarkably well.</p>
<p>He had submitted gracefully to the surveillance,
knowing that in time the man who was
following him would track him to his camp on the
Isthmus. That was the very point. He would
not know where to look for the plotters, but they
would know where to look for him. He depended
on them to send a man to work him
mischief, and reckoned on being able to follow
that man back to his principals.</p>
<p>This they had done. The men who had employed
the spy on the ship had acted quickly and
had sent a bomb-thrower. Ned shuddered as
he thought of the risk he had taken that night
in going to bed without leaving a guard. He had
overlooked a point in the game there, for he had
not apprehended such prompt action on the part
of the men he had pitted himself against.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>However, the plan had miscarried because of
his waking at the critical moment, and here he
was, at the door of the men who had sent the man
about their murderous work. But were these
the principals? When he thought of the two
who had hastened off toward Gatun in a motor
car he did not believe that they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to look in other places besides
subterranean chambers for the men in charge,&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;These fellows are merely tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the sharp click-click of metal came
no more through the heavy air of the room, and
Ned, awaking Jimmie, who had fallen asleep
again, moved into the small room from which the
doorway gave a view of the stairs. He could
see from this room that the sun was shining
brightly outside.</p>
<p>Ned had scarcely stationed himself in the
heavy shadows back of the doorway when four
men came down the passage and passed him.
He had no doubt that they were the workmen
going out for the day. Such work as they did
must needs be done in the night.</p>
<p>Two of the men were tall and slim, with
Spanish-looking faces, and two were short and
stout, with a heavy droop to their shoulders and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
broad faces almost entirely covered with whiskers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original anarchists,&#8221; whispered Jimmie,
as the two short men passed.</p>
<p>After the disappearance of the workmen all
was still in the underground rooms. The door
to the work-chamber had been left open, and Ned
knew that one of two things was the solution to
this.</p>
<p>Either there were other men in the room, or
there were watchers on the outside. He ventured
out in the passage at the foot of the stairs
and looked up. A roughly-dressed man stood
half in view, his back to the watcher. When
Ned turned back he saw Jimmie disappearing
into the work-room. He called softly to him,
but the boy passed on through the doorway and
was lost to sight.</p>
<p>Annoyed at the unnecessary risk taken by
the boy, Ned stepped back into the room he had
just left and waited half expecting to hear a call
for assistance. He knew that he could be of
more assistance there than in the open doorway
to the room which the boy had entered. There
he would at least have the first shot if Jimmie was
pursued and made for the stairs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>While he waited almost holding his breath,
he grasped the bomb he had brought with him
from the cottage. If Jimmie should be killed in
there, the bomb should avenge his death. The
ruins of the temple and the work-shop of the
plotters should all ascend heavenward in one
grand explosion. After a time, however, his
fears were set at rest by the appearance of the
boy, who came up to the doorway with a grin on
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; stirrin&#8217; in there now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed plain now that those interested in
the work which was going on underground were
depending on outside watchers to protect them.
The fire in a rude forge which stood at the
distant end of the chamber was dying out when
the boys reached it, and the place was only dimly
lighted.</p>
<p>On one side of the room was a pile of gas-pipe,
cut in six-inch lengths. In a corner, far
away from the fire, and half buried in the earth&mdash;a
great paving stone having been removed to
make way for the excavation&mdash;were tin vessels
tightly covered. After his experiences of the
night, Ned did not have to inspect the contents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of these tins. He knew very well that they
contained high explosives.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s stuff enough here to blow up the
continent of South America,&#8221; Jimmie said,
pointing at the gas-pipe lengths and the tin
vessels.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they are getting the material in shape
to do the work,&#8221; Ned added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Jimmie answered. &#8220;We&#8217;ve caught
&#8217;em with their workin&#8217; clothes on. We&#8217;ve got
to the bottom of the plot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go too fast, son,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t got a single clue to the men higher up.
It is probable that we have discovered the plant
of the men who are planning to destroy Uncle
Sam&#8217;s big job, but the work we have undertaken
has only begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, catch these men,&#8221; said Jimmie,
&#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got these men, yes, but the chances are that
even they do not know the men who are at the
head of the conspiracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one is puttin&#8217; money into it, anyway,&#8221;
the boy suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we don&#8217;t even know the interests
which are doing it,&#8221; said Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Ned now busied himself about the chamber,
having closed the door so that the light of his
matches would not show. There was, of course,
danger that the watcher might descend the stairs
and discover the closed door, but there was also
the chance that he might attribute the changed
situation to accident.</p>
<p>Presently Ned came upon a battered old
writing desk standing on the head of a large
barrel. The slanting top was locked down, but
the boy soon had it open. Its contents consisted
of two rolls of drawing paper.</p>
<p>Ned took them out, stirred the fire to a sudden
glow, and bent over the figures and lines on
the sheets. His face grew thoughtful as he
looked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>Ned held out the rolls.</p>
<p>&#8220;This one,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a drawing of the
Gatun dam, and this other is a crude sketch of
the basement of the <i>Daily Planet</i> building in
New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;Are they goin&#8217; to
blow that up, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They appear to be thinking of it,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;And there on the margin of the sheets,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
of each of the sheets, is a date line&mdash;Saturday,
April 15th. This is the 13th.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the date set for the explosion?&#8221;
asked the boy, with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but it seems
to me that we ought to get out of here and
communicate with Lieutenant Gordon, and also
with Mr. Shaw, in New York. The date marked
here may be the one set for action.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started at once for the door, Ned taking
the sheets with him and hoping to pass the guard
without being seen. As they moved forward,
however, they heard voices, and then a square
of light told them that the door which they had
left closed had been opened, and that three men
were entering.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they turn on the light now,&#8221; Jimmie whispered
in Ned&#8217;s ear, &#8220;there&#8217;ll be somethin&#8217; doin&#8217;
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomers did not light the flaring
torches with which the room was usually illuminated,
but, closing the door, sat down near the
forge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Ned whispered, drawing Jimmie
toward the door, &#8220;that the fate of the Gatun
dam and the <i>Daily Planet</i> building depends on
our getting out of here. Move carefully.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>A FASTING STUNT IS SUGGESTED.</h3>
</div>

<p>While Ned and Jimmie were wondering how
they were to escape from the subterranean chamber,
Frank Shaw sat in the private room in the
old house on the road to the Culebra cut, facing
the gentleman of military carriage and wondering
what would be the next move in the complicated
game.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you known Lieutenant
Gordon?&#8221; the man asked. &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221;
he said, without giving the boy opportunity
to answer the question, &#8220;but I have not yet told
you who I am, and you can hardly be expected to
answer questions asked by an unknown person,
especially when so much is at stake. I am
Colonel Sharrow, of the United States army,
detailed on Canal Zone duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s manners were frank and engaging,
his personal appearance that of an officer in the
service, yet Frank did not trust him. He did
not believe that Lieutenant Gordon had sent for
the boys. He did not make answer to the question
asked concerning the lieutenant, and it was
asked again, in this way:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you known Lieutenant Gordon long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very short time,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were with him in Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met him in Mexico. I did not go there
with him, nor did I travel in his company, except
on the way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he is entirely loyal to the
government?&#8221; was the next question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is,&#8221; was the short reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear you say that,&#8221; Colonel
Sharrow continued. &#8220;I should be sorry to
change the good opinion I have formed of
Lieutenant Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; Frank said, indignantly,
&#8220;that you are inviting an adverse opinion concerning
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the pleasant reply. &#8220;It
was my purpose, in making the remark I did,
to test your loyalty to my very good friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a short silence in the room, during
which Frank could hear his friends moving
about excitedly in the adjoining apartment.
If they were conversing, they were doing so in
whispers, as no words could be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Gordon,&#8221; the Colonel said, &#8220;is
very much devoted to the service, and is especially
interested in the investigation upon which he is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
now engaged. By the way, he seems to have a
very able assistant in the person of Ned Nestor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ned can help some,&#8221; Frank replied, delighted
at this appreciation of his chum.</p>
<p>Colonel Sharrow did not seem to be a bad
fellow, after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Ned will be here with the lieutenant?&#8221;
Frank asked, then.</p>
<p>The Colonel hesitated, smiling more pleasantly
than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the messenger
did not tell you the exact truth. Ned is
not with the lieutenant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then this is a trap,&#8221; exclaimed Frank,
rising to his feet.</p>
<p>The Colonel laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an impetuous young fellow,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be telling me next,&#8221; the boy said,
&#8220;that we are not to meet the lieutenant here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not to meet him here,&#8221; was the
calm reply.</p>
<p>Frank moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a moment,&#8221; said the Colonel, stepping
forward. &#8220;Wait until you hear what I say,
and then you may pursue whatever course seems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
good to you. You were in deadly danger, out
there in the cottage, and we thought best to get
you away. We knew, too, that you were too
loyal to leave the place in defiance of orders,
and so we used this ruse to bring you here, to the
protection of your friends. If Nestor had been
at the cottage we might have explained the situation
to him. What time did he leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what time he left, and why
he went?&#8221; demanded Frank, all his former suspicions
returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only know that he was not there at daybreak,&#8221;
was the reply, &#8220;and so we brought you
away. Why did he leave so suddenly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank looked the Colonel in the eyes unflinchingly,
determined to have the truth out of him,
and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you don&#8217;t know where he is now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel did not reply, and Frank knew
that there was no necessity for continuing the
conversation. He was satisfied that the Colonel
was one of the plotters, perhaps the leader, that
Ned&#8217;s departure from the cottage had not been
detected by the man he had followed into the
jungle, and that his friend, at least up to daybreak,
had not fallen into the hands of the
enemy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>He saw in an instant how the case stood.
The plotters, spying about the cottage at daybreak,
had noted the absence of Ned. Fearful
that he had departed on some errand which
might seriously affect their own interests, they
had resolved to bring the others away and learn
from them, if possible, where Ned had gone.</p>
<p>As the reader has doubtless suspected, this
was the exact truth. The plotters, at the time
the boys were taken from the cottage, did not
know where Ned was. He had not been seen
following the would-be murderer, nor had any
information from the bomb-boom disclosed his
presence there.</p>
<p>Colonel Sharrow had regarded the &#8220;pumping&#8221;
of the boy as certain of success, and was not
a little surprised when he failed to go into the
details of the incident which had taken Ned and
Jimmie away from the cottage. It had seemed
certain to him that the boy would hasten into an
excited account of the peril of the situation. He
did not know how the bomb had been discovered,
or how it had been taken from under the
floor of the cottage, but he knew that it had been
done.</p>
<p>He had depended upon Frank to tell him all
about it, and to explain where Ned had gone and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
why he had left the cottage in the night. He was
greatly worried over the disappearance of the
boy, for he did not know what had been discovered
regarding the attempted destruction of
the cottage and the consequent murder of the
boys. He did not know what steps Ned might
be taking to discover the author of the attempted
outrage of the previous night. Besides, he was
curious to know just how the destruction of the
cottage had been averted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not know where Ned is,&#8221; the Colonel
said, in reply to Frank&#8217;s question. &#8220;We thought
you might assist us in finding him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; was the sharp demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;By telling us what took place at the cottage
last night, and where Ned went when he left&mdash;also
what time he left the cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; Frank said, when the case
had thus plainly been stated. &#8220;I had an idea
you wanted to know what steps are being taken
to bring you and your bomb-thrower to justice.
Well, I refuse to tell you anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel was not yet ready to appear under
his true colors. He had one more issue to
discuss with the boy, and hoped to meet with
better success than he had in the other matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to understand the situation,
or to trust me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You do not
appreciate the peril your friend may be in. If
you did, you would tell us all you know about
the incident. Now, there is another thing I wish
to discuss with you. You are the son of the
owner of the <i>Daily Planet</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you communicated with your father
recently?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since our arrival on the Isthmus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have not heard from him since
your arrival here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And consequently do not know of the peril
he is in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank started and turned pale. He knew
that this information, like that concerning Ned
and the lieutenant, might be false, but he was
anxious just the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;What peril is he in?&#8221; he asked, and the
other smiled to think he had struck fire at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it seems that he is accumulating proof
against the men who are said to be planning to
destroy the big canal, over yonder, and is getting
on the wrong track. The men he is about to
accuse of complicity in the plot are justly indignant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and are preparing to dynamite his building
in case any copy concerning them is sent to the
composing room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be conversant with the affairs
of these men,&#8221; Frank suggested, with a frown.
&#8220;Are you one of the men who sneaked into our
home and chloroformed father and stole my
necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard something about that,&#8221; the Colonel
said, &#8220;and wondered at it. However, we are not
discussing past incidents. What I desire you to
do is to communicate with your father, in the
cipher you sometimes use in your correspondence,
and inform him of what I have just told
you. Say to him that he is mistaken in the
men, and that his building will be destroyed if he
attempts to publish the alleged facts he has on
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Frank said, &#8220;that I can trust
his good judgment. He can take care of himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you refuse to send the message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be a fat, healthy sort of a boy,&#8221;
laughed the other, changing the subject, apparently,
with a suddenness which astonished the
boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have no cause to complain,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do you think you can live without
food?&#8221; was the next question.</p>
<p>Frank saw the meaning of the fellow in his
angry eyes and dropped back into his chair.
The boys in the next room were now talking
excitedly, and some of the exclamations could
be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t open the door we&#8217;ll break it
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was Harry Stevens. The reply was too
faint to be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing to Frank, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was Harry Stevens&#8217; voice again. The
question was immediately followed by a bang
on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep back,&#8221; a voice said. &#8220;This gun is
loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation was a serious one, and Frank
blamed himself for getting into such a trap. If
he had remained at the cottage, he thought,
there would have been no immediate danger to
his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, after a week&#8217;s fast, you might
have strength enough left to write such a communication
to your father as I suggest?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>The manner was unbearable, the tone insulting,
and Frank could hardly restrain himself
from attacking the fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a week,&#8221; he said, his eyes flashing, &#8220;you
and your associates will be in some federal
prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk bravely,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;and I
observe that you are glancing about in search of
some way out of this, to you, disagreeable situation.
Spare your pains! Even if you could
vanquish me and my associate in the next room,
you could not leave the house. It is guarded
by a dozen picked men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that as true as the other things you have
said?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>
<p>The Colonel laughed until his face turned
red and his sides shook.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a bright boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is
quite a pleasure to do business with you. A very
capable boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to the door of the room and looked
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the men?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The dwarf, who had been sitting on a rude
table near the door, swinging his short legs in the
air, looked up with a slight frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got &#8217;em,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, see if you can find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dwarf, called Jumbo by those who knew
him, got off the table and pointed to a window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Use your eyes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Three men stood there looking in. In the
road in front stood the automobile in which the
party had reached the house. On a hilltop perhaps
sixty rods away a little spurt of dust indicated
the approach of another motor car.</p>
<p>The Colonel beckoned to the men to enter.
As they stepped inside three more men entered
from a rear door. They were all dusky, hungry-looking
fellows, with snaky black hair and
shrinking black eyes. They were dressed in tattered
clothes, and carried revolvers in plain view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite an army,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This old house,&#8221; the Colonel began, a sneer
on his thin lips, &#8220;is larger than you may think.
At the top of a wing which stretches back toward
the jungle there is a room where Spanish prisoners
were once confined. With your permission
I&#8217;ll escort you boys there, advising you, in the
meantime, to think the situation over carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puff of dust on the distant hilltop grew
more pronounced, and the chug-chug of a swiftly
moving motor reached the ears of those in the
ancient structure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>A DELEGATION OF BOY SCOUTS.</h3>
</div>

<p>The three men who entered the subterranean
chamber where Ned and Jimmie were hidden did
not go to work at the forge, neither did they
illuminate the place with such poor means as
were at hand. Instead, they settled down in
sullen silence by the dying fire in the forge.
What little talk there was could not be understood
by the lads for the reason that it was conducted
in Spanish.</p>
<p>Ned was waiting in the hope that they would
soon take their departure, but they seemed to be
in no hurry to do so. Finally it was disclosed,
in a few words of broken English, that they were
waiting for some persons of importance to appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t get a move on pretty soon,&#8221;
Jimmie whispered, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to make a break
of some kind. If we don&#8217;t get out directly there
won&#8217;t be any newspaper building in the Shaw
family, and Uncle Sam won&#8217;t have any more
Gatun dam than a robin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must wait until the last moment,&#8221; Ned
replied. &#8220;The guards out there would shoot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
us down before we could reach the head of the
stairs. We can&#8217;t rush them from below.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a long and anxious wait there in the
underground room, especially as so much depended
on the boys getting out. They had no
idea what had happened to the boys left at the
cottage, or what was taking place in New York.
The only thing in their favor was that the workmen
did not light the torches which lay about.
Such an act would have led to their discovery
and precipitated a struggle at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;See if you can&#8217;t reach one of them bombs,&#8221;
Jimmie giggled, nudging Ned in the ribs. &#8220;I
want to eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have about reached that stage myself,&#8221;
Ned replied. &#8220;I never was so empty in my life.
We&#8217;ll have to do something before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I start an&#8217; run?&#8221; suggested Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get a breakfast of lead if you do,&#8221;
Ned replied. &#8220;Sit still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the boys sat back in their corner to
wait, huddled together for the sake of companionship,
and wondering what had become of
their chums at the cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought to be here by this time,&#8221; Jimmie
complained, in a whisper. &#8220;I left plenty of
instructions regarding the route.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>The little fellow did not, of course, know that
the boys were at that moment in the ancient
house near the Culebra cut, nor that an automobile
was speeding over a hill to the north of
the old structure&mdash;watched by his friends with
anxious interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something may have happened to them,&#8221;
Ned said. &#8220;It seems to me that this case is set
on automatic springs. The slightest move on
our part brings out a bang from the other side.
Our opponents are industrious chaps, and that&#8217;s
no fabrication. They keep going every minute
of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;ve won every trick so far,&#8221;
grumbled Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the game is not out yet,&#8221; Ned replied,
hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think these gazabos would get tired
of waitin&#8217; an&#8217; go away,&#8221; Jimmie said, after
another long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are taking turns sleeping,&#8221; Ned replied.
&#8220;I heard one of them snoring a few minutes
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie settled back again, rubbing his stomach
dolefully, and the place seemed to grow
darker before his eyes. When he awoke again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Ned was pulling at his arm, and there was a
great shouting and pounding at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up and get your gun out,&#8221; Ned said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be something started here in a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded the boy, sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The others have come,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;and
there&#8217;ll be lights in here directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so wasted away with hunger,&#8221; Jimmie
said, &#8220;that they&#8217;ll have to shoot pretty straight
to hit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men by the forge now began stirring
the embers preparatory to lighting a torch,
and the others made for the door.</p>
<p>It looked as if there would be open battle in a
moment, but in that moment a shot came from
the outside, followed by a faint cheer.</p>
<p>The three men who had waited in the chamber
drew together, close to the sullen light of
the forge, the torches unlighted in their hands.
They seemed to be whispering together, and the
boys saw them turn their faces toward a corner
not far from the forge.</p>
<p>Two more shots came from outside, and then
a voice cried, in English:</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the door, you chumps.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jack Bosworth,&#8221; cried Jimmie,
bounding toward the entrance.</p>
<p>Ned followed the boy&#8217;s movement for an
instant, and then faced back toward the forge,
where the three workmen had stood. The last
one was just disappearing through an opening
in the wall, and, with a bound the boy was after
him. A heavy plank door snapped shut in his
face.</p>
<p>Then the front door was thrust open, and
Frank, and Jack, and Harry, and Glen, and
Peter dashed through, shouting at the top of
their voices. Jack even lifted up his chin and
howled &#8220;In the prison cell I sit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prison nothin&#8217;,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed, indignantly.
&#8220;We was just goin&#8217; out to find you
fellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the guard at the door said,&#8221;
cried Jack. &#8220;He told us that you were expected
out any minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lads danced about like mad creatures
for a moment, and then settled down to meet the
situation in which they found themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the guards?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are still going at the pace they set
out in,&#8221; laughed Frank, &#8220;they must be pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
near up to San Francisco by this time. I never
saw such running in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you capture them?&#8221; asked
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the same reason you did not capture
the men who were inside,&#8221; laughed Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we did capture &#8217;em,&#8221; insisted Jimmie.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got &#8217;em locked up in a chamber that
opens from that corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;It is true that they
went into a chamber over there, but the door is
locked on the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon remedy that,&#8221; Jack observed,
and in a short time the boys were pounding away
at the plank door with a heavy sledge which had
evidently been used in cutting up the gas-pipe.</p>
<p>When the door was down a narrow passage
was revealed. This, followed by the boys, led
to an opening at the bottom of the knoll on which
the temple had been built. The men who had
operated the bomb factory had escaped, every
one of them, and Ned turned away in disgust at
the luck which seemed to pursue him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man of them got away,&#8221; he grumbled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What you kicking about?&#8221; demanded Jack,
pulling away at the pile of pipe which was evidently
the makings of a supply of bombs. &#8220;You
captured their artillery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can make more,&#8221; Ned replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the maps he found,&#8221; Jimmie cried.
&#8220;Maps showing how to blow up a Gatun dam
and a New York newspaper office. All marked
out. Just like lessons on blowing things up from
a correspondence school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank was all attention immediately. He
had heard something like that before that day,
and asked a score of questions in a breath.</p>
<p>When the story of the drawings was told the
boys gathered about Ned while he pointed out
the lines drawn in what purported to be a sketch
of the basement of the <i>Daily Planet</i> building.
Frank declared that the dots made in the drawing
were located exactly at steel and concrete
foundation points. The plan of destruction had
evidently been prepared by some one familiar
with the structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me,&#8221; Frank said, after a moment&#8217;s
inspection of the drawings, &#8220;that we&#8217;d
better get out of here and reach a cable office.
One of the plotters was kind enough to tell me
what they were about to do, and this looks like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
they mean to keep their word, for once in their
lives, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better be getting out of this, anyway,&#8221;
Jack put in, &#8220;for those chaps are sure to come
back and bring a gang with them. Suppose we
go back to the cottage and see what has been
doing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you came from the cottage here,&#8221;
Ned said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;We left the road
leading from Gatun at the point where you two
left it last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you saw my signs in twigs,&#8221; Jimmie
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure did,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;and we found
your signs in stone out there on the stone pavement,
and Jack bunted one of the guards in the
head with the third rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand this,&#8221; Ned said.
&#8220;Where have you boys been this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning,&#8221; declared Frank. &#8220;It is
most night now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; grinned Jack, &#8220;they went and
got taken prisoners by a martinet of a fellow
and a dwarf, and I had to go and get them out.
Say! But you wait a second, and I&#8217;ll produce
my modest assistant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>He stepped to the edge of the jungle and
whistled shrilly, and the next moment a slender
boy of perhaps fifteen stood by his side, gazing
at the group, now on the pavement of what had
at one time been the court of the temple, with
something of fear in his dark eyes. He was
dressed in clothes which were much too large for
him, and his manner indicated that he was not
at ease in the company of the well-dressed Boy
Scouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Gastong,&#8221; Jack explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s
capable of doing a running stunt that would
make an express train look like it was hitched to
the scenery. Gastong,&#8221; he added, turning the
boy around so that he faced the others, &#8220;this
is the company of bold, bad men you&#8217;ve enlisted
in. What patrol did you say you belonged to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Owl, Philadelphia,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;Looks to me like
he was a piece of the Isthmus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; explained Jack, with the voice and
manner of one standing on a box before a tent
and touting for a curiosity, &#8220;is Gastong, the boy
tramp of the Isthmus. If he had a place to
sleep he would run away from it before night.
If he went to bed with a dime in his pocket he&#8217;d
dream it was there and get up and spend it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
If he was set to digging in a mine he&#8217;d chop his
way through and come out on the other side and
run away. If he was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank clapped a hand over the speaker&#8217;s
mouth and marched him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got no time for stump speeches,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The gazabos we drove off when we
arrived will come back with reinforcements,
and&mdash;and there you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dying to know what has been happening,&#8221;
Ned said, with a laugh. &#8220;It looks to me
as if you boys had been in something of a mess
yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time enough for that when we get back to
the cottage,&#8221; Jack said. &#8220;Come on, Gastong,
and we&#8217;ll lead the bunch to the festive board.
I hope the cook will be there. Say, but why
don&#8217;t you fellows compliment me on me fine
appearance in this menial rig?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t given us time to say a word,&#8221;
laughed Jimmie. &#8220;You look like the cook,
indeed, you do; and you make me hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is another story for the cottage,&#8221;
Jack said, and the boys hastened off toward the
camp which had proved such a source of danger
to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>When they came in sight of the place they
were astonished at seeing Lieutenant Gordon
and the cook sitting side by side on the screened
porch. The cook was still dressed in Jack&#8217;s
clothes, and the lieutenant, who had evidently
just arrived, was speaking rapidly, as if laboring
under great excitement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>JACK AND HIS FRIEND GASTONG.</h3>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Gordon sprang to his feet when
he saw the boys emerging from the jungle, and
stood waiting, his hand on the porch door, while
they entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me a good scare,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a scare comin&#8217; to everybody
to-day,&#8221; grinned Jimmie, &#8220;even to the dagoes
in the bomb chamber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bomb chamber,&#8221; repeated the lieutenant.
&#8220;What have you youngsters been up
to? Where did you find a bomb room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back here in the cellar of a ruined temple,&#8221;
Jimmie started to explain, but the lieutenant
stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we begin at the beginning,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the beginning,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;the
beginning of the story after we left the cottage
in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ned related the story of the finding of
the ruined temple and what had taken place
there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you boys get to the temple?&#8221;
asked the lieutenant, then. &#8220;The last I heard
of you one of the plotters had you in tow, and
Jack was running off after you in the cook&#8217;s
clothing. Where did you boys connect with
each other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; Jack broke in. &#8220;Where did the
cook connect with you? I presume he is the boy
that brought you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said the cook. &#8220;I had no intention
of remaining here. I knew about what would
happen to you boys, and so started on a run for a
&#8217;phone, the idea being to reach the lieutenant.
I was mistaken for Jack, and held up by a man
who must have been left to spy about the cottage,
but I got a chance to hand him one and
got to a &#8217;phone. Since then the lieutenant has
melted a thousand miles of wire making inquiries
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we all got out before the lieutenant
got to us,&#8221; Jimmie cut in. &#8220;I guess this bunch
of Boy Scouts don&#8217;t need any United States
army to pry us out of our troubles. We almost
got here first,&#8221; he added, with a provoking grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get done congratulating yourselves,&#8221;
laughed the lieutenant, &#8220;perhaps you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
will tell me how you boys got to the ruined
temple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell a lie,&#8221; cried Jack, &#8220;I did it.
While I was chasing myself along through the
dust kicked up by the choo-choo car the boys
rolled away in, I came upon a youth who held
me up in the middle of the road and asked how
I&#8217;d like to continue my run against time in an
airship. He was a cheeky looking chap, and
I felt like giving him a poke in the breather,
when he grinned and gave me the Boy Scout high
sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never found a Boy Scout out here in
the jungle?&#8221; exclaimed Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I did,&#8221; Jack continued. &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t believe it, go back there to the cookerie.
He&#8217;s filling up on the beans I was expecting to
get myself. Call him my dear Gastong, and
he&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cripes!&#8221; cried Jimmie, and he was away in
a second, attacking the great dish of pork and
beans which stood on the table in the cookroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gastong,&#8221; continued Jack, looking longingly
into the cook room, &#8220;was born on the
Isthmus, and knows all about conditions here,
but he&#8217;s too aristocratic to mix with the inhabitants
for any great length of time. He&#8217;s got the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
highfaluting blood all right, but he is shy of the
skads, so he protects his dignity and pride of race
by bumming his way over the world, like an
English milord with a ruined castle and an overdraft
at the bank. He learned to talk United
States in New York, and got to be a Boy Scout
in Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Details of pedigree and biography later,&#8221;
said Ned. &#8220;Did he have an airship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the next best thing to it,&#8221; Jack
replied. &#8220;He had a motor car which he was
running for some gazabo over in Gatun. He was
out for his health when he saw the boys shooting
by in a car with a man he knew to be a crook,
and was about to follow on and see what was
doing when he saw me speeding up the right of
way, looking as if I was obliged to catch the
machine ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He left his car around the corner of the hill
and met me on foot, with about a dozen Boy
Scout signs on tap and a score of badges of honor
hidden away in his ragged clothes. He told me
what he thought of the man who was running
the car ahead, and I told him how he would be
patrol leader on the Golden Streets just because
he was a Boy Scout and was there at that time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
so we got into his machine and followed the crook
in the lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the tramps?&#8221; laughed Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we saw the boys go into that old
house, we knew there was something crooked
going on, and Gastong said to me that if I
wouldn&#8217;t give him away he would put me wise
to a bunch of hoboes that were camping out in
the jungle, too lazy to work, and just about ripe
for a scrap. So we rounded up the hoboes and
made a break for the old house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; cried Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;And got there just in time to see Frank
and his friends going to the floor with a lot of
has-been wrestlers the man in charge of the house
had precipitated on them,&#8221; Jack went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the people who were in the
house?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up in the air,&#8221; cried Frank. &#8220;Say, they
got out so fast that they melted a path all down
the hill to the motor car. We ought to have
fixed that so it wouldn&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the hoboes?&#8221; asked the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone back to camp, wearied out with their
exertions,&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;They came to the
Isthmus to work on the canal, but found the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
climate didn&#8217;t agree with them, so they are
taking the rest cure. I was a find for them, all
right. They&#8217;ve got money enough to live on for
a month, and I&#8217;ve got to wire Dad for more
soap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pleasure to bump into a nice, bright
little boy like you,&#8221; grinned Jimmie, standing
in the doorway with a great slice of bread in his
hand. &#8220;Here you had an army big enough to
surround that old ruin, an&#8217; yet you went an&#8217;
let the fellers get away. An&#8217; we&#8217;ve been blowed
up, an&#8217; locked up, an&#8217; chased in motor cars, an&#8217;
gone without our eatin&#8217;s, an&#8217; nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;.
Up to date we&#8217;re about as useless on the Isthmus
as an elephant&#8217;s ear on an apple pie&mdash;big enough
to be in the way, but not good enough to become
part of the diversion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was now a call from the cook, and
there was no further talk of the situation for the
next half hour. The lieutenant was fully as
active at the table as the others, and the newcomer,
Gastong, as Jack persisted in calling him,
seemed to forget that he had invaded the kitchen
half an hour before and paid his respects to a
pan of baked beans. After the meal a council
was called on the porch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You all understand,&#8221; Lieutenant Gordon
said, &#8220;that you cannot remain here without being
constantly on guard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Frank said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you know that the men who have been
seen in connection with this plot will now disappear
from the game and new men take their
places?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the worst feature of the case,&#8221; Ned
said, thoughtfully. &#8220;My theory worked first
rate up to a certain point. I was put in communication
with some of the underlings in the
plot, just as I planned I should be, but they all
got away. The men who are at the head of this
conspiracy will not permit the fellows who have
appeared in one of the roles to appear again.
We haven&#8217;t gained a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except a more definite knowledge of the
purposes of the plotters,&#8221; suggested the lieutenant.
&#8220;We know now that it is the Gatun
dam that is threatened, and that the newspaper
building in New York will soon become a mass
of ruins unless some action is taken at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also we know where they made their
bombs,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t know where they will make
them in future,&#8221; said Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about staying here?&#8221; asked the
lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doubtless as safe here as anywhere,&#8221;
Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I want to stay here,&#8221; the irrepressible
Jimmie put in. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got on
speakin&#8217; terms with the scenery yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be another bomb under the
house this minute,&#8221; Frank said, starting up from
his chair. &#8220;The place has been alone all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys swarmed out of the porch like a
colony of bees looking for a new home, and while
some crawled under the floor of the cottage,
others penetrated the jungle for some distance
in every direction. There were no suspicious
objects under the floor, and the jungle seemed
to present a peaceful attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about having the old temple and the
deserted house watched for a time?&#8221; asked Jack,
as all returned to the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that, Ned?&#8221; asked
the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are watched at all,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;it is my idea that the work should be done very
secretly, and no arrests made there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; Glen Howard remarked, &#8220;there was
a dwarf in the house named Jumbo. He didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
seem to like the gang he was training with, and I
thought we might be able to get him to keep an
eye out for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and see him,&#8221; Jimmie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, go walking right up to the front door
and knock, and say you would like to sell the
lady of the house a carpet sweeper, and you&#8217;ll
get a piece of lead in your anatomy,&#8221; Jack said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Jimmie grinned, &#8220;when I go to
call on Jumbo I&#8217;ll get an airship an&#8217; drop down
out of the blue into the chimney. Say, you
fellers make me tired. Do you really want to
get this Jumbo person into the game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might not be a bad idea,&#8221; Ned replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; grinned Jimmie, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
me private secretary look him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have him look up my emerald
necklace, while he is about it,&#8221; laughed Frank.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to lose that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I have before remarked,&#8221; said the lieutenant,
&#8220;find Pedro and you&#8217;ll find the necklace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he&#8217;s soaked it,&#8221; Frank put in.</p>
<p>About dark Lieutenant Gordon arose to go
back to Ancon and Jimmie and Peter Fenton
moved down the little path with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; the lieutenant said. &#8220;You boys
mustn&#8217;t be seen with me. You are not supposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
to be connected with the secret service in any
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; chuckled Jimmie.
&#8220;I suppose they come here an&#8217; put bombs under
our cottage, an&#8217; lug us off to deserted houses, an&#8217;
all that, thinkin&#8217; we&#8217;re down here in search of a
new kind of butterfly. If anybody should ask
you, the plotters know just as much about our
arrangement as we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned, who had been following along behind
the others, broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy has the situation sized up correctly,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come along,&#8221; growled the lieutenant.
&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a look at the Culebra
cut,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;You said we might ramble
about the Isthmus all we wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why go with me, and at night?&#8221; asked
the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to see the work going on under
electricity,&#8221; Peter replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them go,&#8221; advised Ned. &#8220;If they can&#8217;t
take care of themselves it is time we found it
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact was that the boys had learned from
the cook that the lieutenant had come to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
vicinity of the cottage in an automobile, and
they thought this a fine chance to secure a ride
to the famous excavation. There was at least
another member of the party who seemed to
think just as they did, for when the machine
purred out into the rough road leading from
the path to Gatun the slight figure of Gastong
vaulted into the back seat with the boys and
motioned to them to remain quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; whispered Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t let me go,&#8221; suggested
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve ducked an&#8217; dodged so long that
you&#8217;re afraid of everybody,&#8221; returned Jimmie.
&#8220;I guess any of our friends can go where we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gastong, however, had not given the true
reason for wishing to keep his presence in the car
a secret from the lieutenant. The boy had been
so considerately treated by the Boy Scouts that
he was infatuated with them, and wished to serve
them in some important way.</p>
<p>Not having any steady occupation or place of
residence, the boy had been driven about alike
by the native authorities and the army officers
until he was, as Jimmie declared, afraid of any
one having authority. He had been treated as
an equal by the boys, and was determined to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
serve them. He had heard the talk of enlisting
the dwarf, Jumbo, in the cause represented by
the secret service men, and was now resolved to
return to the deserted house and look the little
fellow up.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the machine drew near to
the house which the lads had visited that
day under such unfavorable circumstances he
dropped out and was soon lost in the shadows
of the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; Jimmie demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he can do a better job there than
either of us could,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when we come back from the cut,&#8221;
Jimmie said, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to drop off here an&#8217; see
how the chump is gettin&#8217; along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking back, they saw a light flare up in the
house, and then die out!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE JUNGLE AT NIGHT.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Just look at it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant, after many warnings against
getting in the way, and against getting lost in
the jungle, had just left Peter and Jimmie,
and the boys stood at the verge of the great
Culebra cut, taking in the wonder and the force
of the marvelous scene.</p>
<p>Night and day, under the great white lights,
the work went forward, cutting a way for the
commerce of the world. Night and day the
human ants bored into the earth. Continuously
the blasting and scraping, the puffing and the
roaring, went on. Always the great steam shovels
were biting into the soil and the rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t look like the deep blue sea
down there, does it?&#8221; Peter went on, &#8220;yet the
largest vessels in the world will be sailing over
here in four years, sailing through this cut, and
over a forest beyond the rise there. It looks
big, doesn&#8217;t it? And it sounds big, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>From where the boys stood there seemed to
be a hopeless confusion of men and machines,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
but they knew that back of all the hurry, and
bustle, and noise, was a great machine, a wonderful
system, born in a human brain and reaching
its lines out to the smallest detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you sit on a fire-escape balcony, or in
a park,&#8221; Jimmie said, his mind going back to the
New York lounging places he knew best, &#8220;and
read about how many tons of earth have been
removed during the week, you don&#8217;t sense it,
do you? You&#8217;ve got to come down here and
catch Uncle Sam at his job.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the boys talked of the marvelous thing
before them a stranger of quiet mien stood
watching them from an elevation a few yards
away. He was a man of middle age, with brilliant
black eyes, long, like those of an Oriental,
and a figure almost boyish in its proportions.
He was neatly dressed in a dark suit of some soft,
expensive material, his linen was spotless, and a
diamond of great value and brilliancy glimmered
in his pure white tie.</p>
<p>He stood watching the boys for a moment
listening to their talk, and then approached
them, softly, deferentially, yet with an air of
frankness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful sight,&#8221; he said, as he came
to the edge of the cut where the lads stood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
&#8220;In all the world&#8217;s life there has never been anything
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys turned and looked the man over
modestly, yet with sharp eyes. It is not to be
wondered at, after their experiences there, that
they were suspicious of all strangers. They both
at first rather liked the looks of the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth coming a long way to see,&#8221;
Peter observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;it is wonderful, even
to those who are small cogs in the great machine,
and so it must seem almost supernatural in its
showing of strength to those who look upon it
for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You belong on the works?&#8221; asked Jimmie,
gazing at the man with a sort of awe, as one
might look at a man of mighty deeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have my part in the work,&#8221; was the
reply, &#8220;though it is only a modest part. I am
in the office of the engineer, and frequently come
out at night to note the progress of the big cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must make a man feel a mile high, to be
part of a thing like this,&#8221; Jimmie said, sweeping
a hand over the scene. &#8220;It makes little old
New York look like thirty cents,&#8221; he added,
with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The work,&#8221; the stranger said, in a pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
tone, which gave no indication of foreign birth
&#8220;has progressed beyond the expectations of
the most enthusiastic advocate of the canal.
When we came here we found about seven miles
of waterway bored into the side of the Isthmus,
reaching, well, about up to the rising slope of
Gatun. Beyond this there were scratches in the
soil for about forty miles. There was a notch
nicked in the hills of Culebra&mdash;just a nick bearing
no resemblance to what you see before you at
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was over there where the hills rise
up like men watching the lights and listening
to the noise?&#8221; asked Jimmie, his imagination
thoroughly stirred by the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, over there. It would have taken the
Frenchmen a century to dig down to the level
where those shovels are working, where those
tracks lie. I&#8217;m afraid it took the men they
brought here most of the time to bury the dead.
But, after all, they never got in touch with the
really big thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that was the Chagres river,&#8221; Peter
said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve read something about that, about the
trouble it makes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was the river,&#8221; the stranger went
on, by this time pretty deep in the confidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
and admiration of the boys. &#8220;They found the
Chagres having everything its own way on the
uplands, over to the north, there. It ambled
along like a perfect lady in spots, then it twisted
its water into whirling ropes which pulled at the
banks and toppled cliffs into the current.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Freshets?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. When the engineers came they
found something worth while. They found a
dismal, soggy-looking ditch which could do
things in a single night. They found crumbling
and shaling cliffs which showed the bite of the
waters. Time and again they had to do their
work all over again. Then they decided to take
the Chagres by the neck and choke it into subjection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see some one choke a river,&#8221;
Jimmie laughed. &#8220;You try to choke a river and
you&#8217;ll find that the harder you clutch it the more
trouble it will make you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they not only choked the Chagres,&#8221;
the stranger said, with a captivating smile which
went far toward giving him the complete confidence
of the boys, &#8220;they put it in chains. If
you look on a detail map of the Isthmus, you
will see a white band stretching from Limon Bay
to La Boca, just below the hill of Ancon. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
is the line of the canal. Then, across this white
band, you will see a crooked line, a turning and
twisting line. That is the river, which seems to
change its mind about general direction every few
minutes. The engineers found this river in the
habit of getting up in the night and tearing their
work in pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they cut a straight channel for
it?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was tried, but finally the engineers
decided to stop trying to make the river behave
itself, as a river, and turned their attention to
squelching it. They are going to turn it into a
lake&mdash;the Lake of Gatun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard something about that,&#8221; Jimmie
said. &#8220;Go on and tell us more about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger smiled pleasantly, but there was
a sudden quickening of the flame in his brilliant
eyes which the boys did not notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The upland portion of the Isthmus, the
plateau, as it would be called in Mexico, is fairly
level from Gatun to the Culebra hills. It might,
in fact, be called a shallow basin, with hills
shutting it in. Now do you see what the Gatun
dam is for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. To flood that basin and turn the
Chagres into a lake,&#8221; cried Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what will be done. The Panama
canal will be a lake most of the way. The
locks will float the vessels up to the lake and
down to the canal again. The hills, and forests,
and farms of the basin will be under water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the mines,&#8221; Jimmie said, thinking of the
talk he had had with Peter concerning the emerald
mines. &#8220;The lake will flood them, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no mines there any more,&#8221; the
stranger said, lightly, but there was a quality in
his voice which almost asked a question instead
of making a statement of fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering if there wasn&#8217;t mines
down there,&#8221; Jimmie added, in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of mines?&#8221; asked the stranger.</p>
<p>Jimmie was about to say &#8220;Emerald mines,&#8221;
but Peter&#8217;s anxious face warned him to check the
words on his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve heard of all kinds of mines about
there,&#8221; he said, instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mines are farther south,&#8221; said the
stranger. &#8220;Are you boys with a party?&#8221; he
added, in a moment. &#8220;If not, I would like to
have you spend the night as my guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a camp back here,&#8221; Peter said,
&#8220;and the others will be expecting us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;You are the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
who are here in search of specimens. I recall
something Lieutenant Gordon said about you.
But you are a long way from the cottage in the
jungle near Gatun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you see Lieutenant Gordon last?&#8221;
asked Peter, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met him something over half an hour ago,&#8221;
was the reply, &#8220;on his way back to the Tivoli at
Ancon. You came here in his machine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to Gatun to-night, and
you may ride with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger turned away, as if to get his
motor car, and Peter nudged Jimmie in the ribs
with his elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a man after us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he is one of the men we came
here to look up?&#8221; asked Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
thinking he looks like a Jap. Perhaps he&#8217;s one
of the men at the bottom of that bomb business.
Well, we don&#8217;t have to go with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see where he would take us,&#8221;
Peter whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for your uncle,&#8221; Jimmie replied. &#8220;It
is me for the jungle. This thing is gettin&#8217; worse &#8217;n&#8217; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Bowery drama. The villain comes on in
every scene here. Say! Suppose we take a run
into the woods before he gets back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in love with the jungle at night,&#8221;
Peter said. &#8220;Besides, I&#8217;d like to know what
this Jap has in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chug-chug of the stranger&#8217;s motor was
now heard, and, without waiting for further discussion,
the boys ducked away into the jungle,
which crowded close on the cut at this point.</p>
<p>They heard the car stop at the point where
they had been standing, and heard a low exclamation
of impatience, indicative of disappointment,
from the lips of the driver, and then
crept farther into the tangle of vines.</p>
<p>Finally Peter stopped and faced toward
Gatun.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better be working toward home,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;This thicket is no place for a civilized
human being at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there was a moon, and the sky
showed great constellations with which the boys
were unfamiliar, the jungle was dark and creepy.
Keeping the lights from the workings on their
left, the boys pushed their way through the
undergrowth for some distance without resting,
and then paused in a little glade and listened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; cried Jimmie, after standing at attention
for a moment, &#8220;there&#8217;s some one following
us. We&#8217;d better dig in a little deeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a wild animal,&#8221; said Peter, who,
while ready to face whatsoever peril might come
in the company of the man they were running
away from, was in mortal terror of the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no man-eaters here,&#8221; Jimmie
replied, unwinding a snake-like creeper from his
neck and pushing on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can feel snakes crawling up my legs now,&#8221;
complained Peter, with a shiver.</p>
<p>The noise in the rear came on about as fast
as they could move, and at last Jimmie sat down
on a fallen tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can hear us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We might as
well be hiding with a brass band.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll keep quiet until he passes,&#8221;
Peter trembled out. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to go plunging
through here in the dark, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making as little noise as possible, the boys
crept into a particularly dense thicket and
crouched down. Almost as soon as they were
at rest the noise behind ceased. In five minutes
it began again, but the sounds grew fainter
and fainter and finally died out.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was followin&#8217; us all right,&#8221; Jimmie said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll dig in a little deeper, so as not to
come out anywhere near him, and then go back
to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked, or crept, rather, until they
were tired out and then looked about.</p>
<p>There were giant ceiba trees, with trunks as
smooth as if they had been polished by human
hands, tremendous cotton-trees, their branches
bowed down with air plants, palms, to which
clung clusters of wild nuts, thick, bulbous trees,
taller trees with buttressed roots, as if Nature
knew the strain that was to be placed upon them
and braced them up accordingly, trees with bark
like mirrors, and trees with six-inch spike growing
from the bark.</p>
<p>And through this thicket of trees ran creepers
resembling pythons, smaller vines which tore at
the boughs of the trees, and a mass of running
things on the ground which caught the foot and
seemed to crawl up toward the throat. By daylight
it would have been weird and beautiful.
At night it was uncanny and fearsome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be in sight of the lights by this
time,&#8221; Peter said, after they had crept on and
rested again and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jimmie, &#8220;but we ain&#8217;t. We&#8217;re
lost in the jungle, if you want to know.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>BOY SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Ned Nestor and Frank Shaw sat on the porch,
that night, for a long time after the other boys
were asleep. It had been decided that Frank
should stand guard until midnight, but Ned
was far too anxious to attempt to sleep. The
absence of Jimmie and Peter worried him, and
he sat waiting for some sign of their approach
until very late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank,&#8221; he said, after a long silence, &#8220;there
has been some talk in this case about your father
having an interest in an emerald mine down
here. Have you any idea where that mine is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the slightest,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;All I
know about it is that it is a paying proposition,
and that foreigners are in the game with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not even know whether the mine is
situated in the Province of Panama?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard talk,&#8221; Ned went on, &#8220;about
mines on the line of the canal. It may be that
this one is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is not far from Colon,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who these foreigners are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Japanese, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned was silent for a time, as if studying some
proposition over in his mind. The boys in the
cottage were stirring in their sleep, and a shrill-voiced
bird in the jungle was calling to its mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to get at?&#8221; Frank
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it ever occurred to you,&#8221; Ned replied,
&#8220;that your father acted rather strangely on the
night he was attacked in his house&mdash;the night
your emerald necklace was stolen and the office
building searched?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never thought of his attitude as
remarkable,&#8221; replied Frank, &#8220;but, come to think
the matter over from this distance, it does seem
that he did act queerly when asked to reveal
the nature of the information he had received.
Lieutenant Gordon was angry with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the lieutenant believed that the papers
would help him a lot if he could get hold of
them. He still thinks so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that he still, in his mind, accuses
father of disloyalty to his country,&#8221; said
Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; Ned continued, &#8220;that one
of two propositions is true. Either the papers
would be useless in revealing the plot, or they
deal with a situation which your father believes
himself capable of handling alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what he will think when he gets
the cable Lieutenant Gordon took up to Panama
for me?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say in the message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him to keep an army of men in the
basement of the newspaper building&mdash;to look
out for bombs all over the structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you were able to warn him,&#8221; Ned
said, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t help believing that he knew
something of the peril he was in before we left
New York. He was altogether too quiet that
night when his house and his office were searched.
He appeared to me to be planning a revenge both
effective and secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he never made a row about Pedro leaving
him,&#8221; Frank said. &#8220;Why, he used to think
Pedro was the whole works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say the fellow&#8217;s name is not Pedro at
all, but Pedrarias?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what father says. I gave him
the name of Pedro for short. He is an offshoot
of the Spanish family that ruled the Isthmus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
after Balboa was shot. He claims pure Castilian
blood, and all that. How he ever consented to
become a servant is more than I can make out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it never occurred to you,&#8221; asked Ned,
&#8220;that he might have had an object, besides that
of salary, in acting the part of a menial?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought, since the night of the robbery,
that he might have scented the necklace
from afar off and come there to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father found him on the Isthmus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; on his latest trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He consulted with him, in a way, concerning
conditions here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think he did. Pedro is a very intelligent
man, and proud as the Son of the Morning.
He gave me his pedigree about the first
day of his service in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps your father sought his advice
regarding the emerald business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think he did, now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Pedro was always ready to advise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your father grew to put some confidence
in his talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume so, for they talked together a
good deal. But I don&#8217;t see what you are getting
at.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know whether the two discussed
the location and opening up of new mines?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Father is always after new
mines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he looking for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Isthmus and all through the republic
of Colombia, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And especially on the Isthmus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Pedro was active in looking up possible
workings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he used to show father maps and plans,
at night, in the study, and they used to pore over
them for hours at a time. But what does that
amount to? Father took him to New York, I
have no doubt, because he thought he would be
useful in that way. The fellow knows every inch
of the Isthmus and South America. Now, let
me ask you a question. Do you think he stole
my emerald necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, frankly, I do not,&#8221; replied Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have a notion that he let the others
into the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he might have done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed guilt when he ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. The fact is that if he did let the
thieves into the house he did not do so especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
to give them a chance to steal the necklace. At
least that is the way I look at it. And, again,
if he did admit them, he permitted them to do a
bungling job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that they didn&#8217;t get what they
wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers concerning the plot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how could they get them if they
weren&#8217;t in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He should have located them before he
turned his confederates loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you really think Pedro was at the
bottom of all that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not said so,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;There
is no knowing whether he was or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t be so secretive,&#8221; Frank
said. &#8220;You have a straight out and out theory
of that night&#8217;s work, and you won&#8217;t tell me what
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never form theories,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would Pedro want of the papers?&#8221;
Frank demanded. &#8220;Was he in the plot to blow
up the dam, or was he just paid to get them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you more about that in a few days.
It is midnight, and I will relieve you. Go to bed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall sleep sounder after I hear from
father,&#8221; the boy said, passing into the cottage.
&#8220;He may be having troubles of his own in New
York,&#8221; he added, pausing at the door for a last
word.</p>
<p>Ned sat for a long time on the screened porch
with the splendor of the tropical night about him.
The jungle came nearly to the walls of the house
on all sides, save in front, where a little clearing
had been made, and the noises, the creature
and vine talk of the thickets, came to his ears like
low music.</p>
<p>He listened constantly for the footsteps of the
absent boys, but for a long time there was no
break in the lilt of the forest. Then&mdash;it must
have been two o&#8217;clock&mdash;he heard the quick beat
of running feet, and directly Gastong, as Jack
had fancifully named his new acquaintance,
came spurting into the cleared space.</p>
<p>He stopped running when he reached the
middle of the cutaway spot and, seeing Ned on
the porch, beckoned to him.</p>
<p>Ned was off the porch in an instant, standing
by the exhausted boy, who was now on the
ground, supporting his swaying figure with one
hand clutching the long grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it,&#8221; asked Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything of the boys, the
two who went away in the car?&#8221; asked the other.
&#8220;Have they come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Ned, filled with a sickening
sense of helplessness, &#8220;they have not returned.
Come inside the screen and speak low, so as not
to wake the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gastong rose slowly to his feet and walked
stumblingly to the porch. Once inside he
dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have run a long distance,&#8221; he said, by way
of apology for his weakened condition. &#8220;I&#8217;m
all in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it about the boys?&#8221; Ned demanded,
clutching the other by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped at the old house,&#8221; began Gastong,
but Ned cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the boys,&#8221; he said, shaking him
fiercely. &#8220;What about the boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are either in the hands of your enemies
or lost in the jungle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were spoken shrinkingly, as if the
news conveyed might be of his own making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you leave them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped at the old house,&#8221; began the other
again, &#8220;and remained there only a few minutes.
Then I went on toward the Culebra cut and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
came upon a friend who told me what had taken
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Well! Well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys stopped at the cut, this side of the
high point, and were there accosted by Gostel.
Oh, you don&#8217;t know Gostel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; was the impatient reply. &#8220;Who
the dickens is Gostel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a spy, a Jap who has been hanging
about the Isthmus ever since the beginning of
the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned was thinking fast. This might mean
something tangible. He had never heard of
Gostel before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of Gostel?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He talked with the boys for a time and
invited them to become his guests for the night.
He referred them to Lieutenant Gordon. I got
it from my friend who heard all their talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they went away with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned&#8217;s voice was harsh and high, and the
boys in the cottage were heard moving about,
as if awakened by his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t go away with him. They
became suspicious of him, and when he went for
his car they ran away into the jungle. A mad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
thing to do. A crazy thing for boys to do, for
strangers. There is death in the jungle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why didn&#8217;t you go in after them?&#8221;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What could I do alone?&#8221; asked the other,
with a little shiver of apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know the country&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gastong interrupted with a gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing the country couldn&#8217;t help me, not
with Gostel and his men trailing into the jungle
after the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a new fear creeping into Ned&#8217;s
heart, and he was beginning to realize that there
are perils more to be dreaded than the perils of
the jungles.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many went in?&#8221; asked Ned, in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, half a dozen&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. Some one
must go for help. Gostel will kill the boys. I
should think that after the experiences of the
afternoon&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready to go this minute,&#8221; Ned said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must have torches, and guns,
and stand ready to fight against wild beasts as
well as against men. There are jaguars in
there, and boas&mdash;serpents ten yards in length.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Natives have been killed by jaguars within the
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jaguars rarely come as far north as this,&#8221;
Ned said, &#8220;and your serpents are not dangerous,&#8221;
but the other insisted that there were both
jaguars and boas in the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man Gostel may have gone to the
rescue of the boys,&#8221; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>Gastong laughed weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I tell
you he is a spy, a Japanese spy, watching every
inch of the canal as it is excavated. He is in the
pay of hostile interests, and will work you all a
mischief. He knew before you arrived that you
were coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>Gastong&#8217;s replies to the question were not
satisfactory, and so Ned gave over questioning
him. The sleeping boys were aroused and in
ten minutes, just as a faint tint of day came into
the east, they were away to the jungle&mdash;taking
the way to Gatun at first, as the thicket they
sought was far to the southeast of that city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THE KILL IN THE JUNGLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>It was growing darker every minute in the
jungle, for there were now fleecy clouds in the
sky, and the moon was not always in sight.
Following Jimmie&#8217;s statement that they were
lost, the boys stood stock still in a dense thicket
and tried once more to get their bearings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got something figured out wrong,&#8221;
Peter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we have,&#8221; Jimmie insisted.
&#8220;See here! That is the moon up there? What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s got lost,&#8221; Jimmie continued.
&#8220;Ever stand behind the scenes in a theatre and
hold a moon up on a stick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did, on the Bowery, once, and I got
so interested in what was goin&#8217; on in front that
the moon set in the east. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the
matter with this moon. Some&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no supe holding up this moon on
a stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;ve moved the Panama canal,&#8221; insisted
Jimmie. &#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t, we would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
come to the cut a long time ago. That moon
is supposed to be in the south. It ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps a little west of south.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we crossed over the ditch down here,
didn&#8217;t we, and struck into the jungle from the
west side of the Culebra cut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if we keep the moon in the south, on
our right, we&#8217;ll come back to the cut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Anyway, we ought to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Old Top, we&#8217;ve been walkin&#8217; for the
last two hours with the moon on our right, and
we haven&#8217;t got anywhere, have we? You don&#8217;t
see no lights ahead of us, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were no signs of the big cut. The
great lights which blazed over the workings were
not to be seen. The noises of the digging, the
dynamiting, the pounding of the steam shovels,
the nervous tooting of the dirt trains, might have
been a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to show me,&#8221; Peter said, after
studying over the matter for a moment. &#8220;That
moon isn&#8217;t on no stick on a Bowery stage. It
is there in the south, where it belongs, and if we
continue to keep it on our right we&#8217;ll come to the
canal in time. We are farther away than we
thought for.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>They struggled on through the jungle for
another half hour, and then stopped while
Jimmie looked reproachfully at the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what kind of a country this
is, anyway,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;I never saw the
moon get off on a tear before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except when you had it on the end of a
stick,&#8221; said Peter, with a noise which was intended
for a laugh, but which sounded more like
a sigh of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got to stay here until morning,&#8221;
Jimmie said, presently, &#8220;and I&#8217;m so hungry that
I could eat a boa constrictor right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit!&#8221; cried Peter. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about
snakes, or you&#8217;ll bring them down on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was coarse, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; observed
Jimmie. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll withdraw the remark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we stay here until morning,&#8221; Peter said,
dubiously, &#8220;how do we know the sun won&#8217;t
rise in the west?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Jimmie replied. &#8220;Guy me if
you want to, but you&#8217;ll find this is no joke before
we get through with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that now,&#8221; Peter replied. &#8220;I never
was so tired in my life, and I&#8217;d give a ten-dollar
note for a drink of cold water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys sat down on dry tree knuckles, buttressed
roots rising three feet from the soil, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
discussed the situation gravely. After a short
time Peter got up with a start and began prancing
about the little free space where they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We&#8217;re both
chumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They usually act that way when they&#8217;re
dyin&#8217; of hunger an&#8217; thirst,&#8221; Jimmie said, dolefully.
&#8220;Keep quiet, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll feel better in a
short time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I know which way to go now,&#8221; Peter
insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to tell
which is north by the moss on the trees. Or
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to tell which way is northeast by the
way the breeze lays the bushes. Or you&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to make a compass out of the dial of your watch.
I&#8217;ve read all about it. But we&#8217;re stuck, just the
same, not knowin&#8217; the constellations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stuck&mdash;nothing,&#8221; cried Peter. &#8220;Look here.
Which way does the Panama canal run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;North and south, across the Isthmus, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong! From Gatun
to Panama the line of the cut is more east and
west than north and south. Now revise your
opinion of the moon. At this time of night she
would be in the southwest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That would make a little difference,&#8221; admitted
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there you are. Take a line running
southeast and a couple of chumps going almost
southeast by keeping a southwest object to the
right, where will they land? That&#8217;s mixed, but
I guess you know what it means. Where would
a couple of chumps find the southeast line?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About next week at two o&#8217;clock,&#8221; cried
Jimmie. &#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ll start right now, an&#8217;
get out of the jungle before daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few moments after taking a fresh start
the boys came to a place where a small body of
water made a clearing in the forest. The little
lake, or swamp, for it was little more than a well-filled
marsh, was of course walled about by trees
and climbing vines, but there was a lane to the
southwest which permitted the light of the moon
to fall upon the water.</p>
<p>The surface of the pool was well covered with
floating plants, and now and then, as the boys
looked through the undergrowth, a squirming
thing ducked under and out of sight. There
was something beautiful about the spot, and
yet it was uncanny, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish that was all right for a drink,&#8221;
Jimmie observed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right for a drink&mdash;if you&#8217;re tired of
living,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he added, pointing,
&#8220;what do you think of that for a creeper, over
there? I&#8217;m sure I saw it climbing down off
that tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie took one look and started away,
drawing Peter with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a python!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no pythons in this country,&#8221;
Peter replied, pulling back and looking out over
the water again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a boa, then,&#8221; Jimmie cried. &#8220;Come
away. It is getting out of the tree!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys did not move for a moment. They
seemed to be fascinated by what they saw. It
was a serpent at least ten yards in length&mdash;a
serpent showing many bright colors, a thick,
elongated head, a body at least ten inches in
diameter, and a blunt tail. As it moved down
the column of the tree it launched its head out
level in the air as if anticipating a feast of Boy
Scout. The shining head, the small, vicious
eyes, drew nearer to the faces of the watchers,
and it seemed as if the serpent was about to leap
across the pool.</p>
<p>Directly, however, the reptile threw its head
and the upper part of its body over a limb on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
a tree nearer to the boys and drew its whole
squirming body across.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is coming over here, all right,&#8221; whispered
Peter. &#8220;Can you hit it? A bullet landed
in that flat head might help some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie would not have admitted fright, but
his voice was a trifle shaky. It is no light thing
for a boy reared on the pavements of New York
to face a serpent in the midst of a tropical forest
at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shoot, then,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold
my fire until we see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie drew his revolver and waited for a
moment, as the head of the snake was now in the
shadow of the tree. When it came out again,
still creeping nearer to the boys, swaying, reaching
out for another tree which would have
brought it within striking distance, the boy took
careful aim and fired.</p>
<p>There was a puff of smoke, the smell of burning
powder, a great switching in the branches of
the tree. Peter seized Jimmie by the arm and
drew him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t hit him he&#8217;ll jump,&#8221; the boy said.</p>
<p>When the smoke which had discolored the
heavy air drifted away, they saw the serpent still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
hanging from the limb, pushing his head out this
way and that and flashing a scarlet tongue at its
enemies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hit him, all right,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;Try
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the third shot the body of the serpent
hung down from the tree with only a stir of life.
It was evident that at least one of the bullets
had found the brain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will hang there until it decays,&#8221; Peter
said. &#8220;That tail will never let go. Come on
away. It makes me sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always two where there&#8217;s one,&#8221;
Jimmie said, &#8220;and we must move cautiously, for
there would be no release from the coils of a
snake like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I heard something moving in
there a moment ago,&#8221; Peter said, pointing away
from the pool. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go in and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you stir,&#8221; advised Jimmie. &#8220;There&#8217;s
some one in there. I heard voices. We have
been followed all this long way, and the shooting
must have located us.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a very natural conclusion, and the
boys crept behind the bole of a tree and waited
for what seemed to them a long time. Then
footsteps were heard, soft, stealthy steps, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
those of a man walking in padded stockings.
The great leaves of a huge plant with red blossoms
moved, and a pair of fierce eyes looked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a panther,&#8221; whispered Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;A South American jaguar,&#8221; Peter corrected.
&#8220;They eat men when they get desperately
hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great cat moved out from behind the
plant and stood in the shaft of moonlight. It
was a graceful beast, an alert, handsome creature
of the woods, but did not look in that way
to the boys just then.</p>
<p>In size it was nearly the equal of the full
grown tiger. The head was large, the body
thick yet supple, the limbs robust. In color it
was of a rich yellow, with black rings, in which
stood black dots, marking the sides.</p>
<p>The beast is known as the South American
tiger, and is by far the most powerful and dangerous
of tropic beasts of prey. It is swift
enough to capture horses on the open pampas
and strong enough to drag them away after
the kill. In some of the countries south of the
Isthmus the jaguar is a menace to the inhabitants,
and settlements have been deserted because
of them. It is rarely that one is found as far
north as the Isthmus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>While the boys watched the cat slipped out
one soft paw after the other and looked about,
as if awakened from sleep. Then it moved
toward the tree behind which the boys were
partly concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for it,&#8221; whispered Peter. &#8220;If we miss
it is all off with one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not come here,&#8221; Jimmie said,
hopefully. &#8220;He was probably brought here by
the smell of blood. Say! Don&#8217;t you hear something
back of us? This cat&#8217;s mate may be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the cat&#8217;s mate was there. Not looking
in their direction, but sitting up like a house cat,
watching the swaying body of the serpent. Her
nose was pushed out a trifle, as if scenting supper
in the dangling horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mate is here, all right,&#8221; Peter said, in a
whisper. &#8220;We&#8217;re between the two of them.
What is the first one doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming on,&#8221; whispered Jimmie, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
got only three shots in my gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you will have time to use if you
miss the first one,&#8221; Peter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Jimmie returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have to shoot together,&#8221; Peter
went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your hand steady?&#8221; asked Jimmie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As a rock,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Good-bye to
little old New York if it wasn&#8217;t. Funny notion
that a jaguar should be trying to eat a Wolf and
a Black Bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a baby Wolf, too,&#8221; added Jimmie.
&#8220;My beast is coming on, bound to investigate
this tree. When he gets so close that he can
spring I&#8217;ll give the word, and we&#8217;ll shoot together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cat approached slowly. At first it did
not seem to catch the scent of prey in the neighborhood
of the tree. It came on with cautious
steps, crouching low, as if ready to leap.</p>
<p>Then the female caught sight and scent of the
boys and uttered a low cry of warning which the
male appeared to understand, for in a second its
ears were laid down on its neck and the belly
touched the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you shoot keep the lead going,&#8221;
advised Jimmy. &#8220;Now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, in that splendid tropical scene, there
was a puff of smoke, one, two, three, four.
Again the odor of burned powder attacked the
nostrils and clouded the heavy air. Again
there was a great floundering in the thicket.</p>
<p>The boys stood waiting for the snarling impact,
but none came.</p>

<h3>SIGNAL FIRES IN THE JUNGLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I guess we got &#8217;em,&#8221; Jimmie cried, as the
smoke drifted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter spoke proudly, just as if there had been
no fear of the result a moment before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s lying down to rest,&#8221; Jimmie went
on. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; up to feel his pulse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he gets a swipe at you, you&#8217;ll wish you
hadn&#8217;t been so curious about his old pulse,&#8221;
Peter observed.</p>
<p>But Jimmie did not at once go toward the
wounded beast. The great cat lifted its head,
gave a cry that echoed and re-echoed through
the forest, and sprang for the tree. The boy&#8217;s
revolver spoke again, and the long hours of practice
with the weapon in the shooting galleries
of New York told. The beast dropped to the
ground with a bullet in the brain, sent in exactly
between the eyes.</p>
<p>The female lifted her head at the cry and tried
to regain her feet, but was not strong enough to
do so. With a turn of her pretty head in the
direction of her mate, she fell back dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost a shame,&#8221; Peter said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be so sorry for the cats if they
had got a claw into you,&#8221; Jimmie observed.
&#8220;Just one claw in the flesh and it would have
been all off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter turned away from the dead animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it seems like a slaughter
house here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; Jimmie cried. &#8220;I want to swing
the cats up so they won&#8217;t be devoured by their
friends of the jungle. I want the skins for rugs.
Guess they will look pretty poor in our patrol
room. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back with you in the daylight,&#8221;
Peter said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll come away now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the glade where they had encountered
such dangers, the boys moved toward the
canal line, keeping the moon, now well toward
the horizon, at their back.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had done this before,&#8221; Jimmie said,
as they forced their way through clusters of
clinging vines, &#8220;we would be at home in bed
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we wouldn&#8217;t have had the jaguar rugs
coming to us,&#8221; answered Peter. &#8220;Glad I didn&#8217;t
think of it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently they came to the top of a little
hill in the jungle and looked out over the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
ahead. There were no canal lights in the distance.
Afar off they could see a faint streak of
dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re going right, after all,&#8221;
Jimmie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must keep a little more to the left,&#8221;
Peter replied. &#8220;The line of the canal runs
almost southeast here, and we are going east.
We&#8217;ll strike it quicker if we turn to the north.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t much like the Great White Way
at daylight,&#8221; commented Jimmie, as a great
creeper settled about his neck, having been
pulled from a tree by his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what we&#8217;re doing in here in the
night, anyway,&#8221; Peter observed. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t
come down here to get big game, but to prevent
enemies of the government getting gay and blowing
up the Gatun dam. Whew! They might
have blowed it up while we&#8217;ve been shooting
snakes and cats. Guess there&#8217;s one of the explosions
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rumbling came toward them from the east.
It was such a rumbling as one hears when great
masses of fireworks are set off at once. Such a
rumbling as one hears in war, when the rifles
are speaking along a line of infantry and cannons
are roaring out above their patter. The ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
shook, and birds, frightened, fled from tree
boughs with strange cries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has gone up,&#8221; Jimmie said.
&#8220;I wish we could see over the tops of that next
line of trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like the crack of doom,&#8221; Peter observed.
&#8220;I wish we could get out of the tall
timber and see what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a white light,&#8221; Jimmie cried,
excitedly. &#8220;That must be the workings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a cloud, just touched with dawn,&#8221;
Peter replied. &#8220;There&#8217;s no sight of the canal
yet. If we could only get out to the cut we&#8217;d
soon be home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221; repeated Jimmie, in disgust, &#8220;we&#8217;re
more&#8217;n fifty miles from camp, the way the roads
run. If we can get a train at Culebra, we may
be able to get home by dark. You must remember
that we rode a long way with the lieutenant.
Culebra is almost to the Pacific. The locks are
there, or near there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can get a train, I guess,&#8221; Peter said,
sleepily. &#8220;I wonder if any of the boys are sitting
up for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet they&#8217;re out hunting for the two of
us,&#8221; Jimmie said. &#8220;It takes one half of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
party to keep the other half from getting killed,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>There were still no signs of the canal line.
The jungle was as dense as ever, and seemed
more desolate and uncanny than ever under the
growing light of day. As the sun arose and
looked down into the green pools vapors arose,
vapors unpleasant to the nostrils and bewildering
to the sight.</p>
<p>Presently the boys came to a little knoll from
which they could look a long way into the jungle
stretching around them. Below were slimy
thickets, tangles of creepers and vines which
seemed to be sentient, but no signs of the work
of man. It was now eight o&#8217;clock in the morning,
and the boys were worn out and hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re out lookin&#8217; for us,&#8221; Jimmie said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give &#8217;em somethin&#8217; to follow. Watch me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they won&#8217;t be anywhere around here,&#8221;
Peter said, as Jimmie began gathering dry twigs
and branches from the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll begin where Lieutenant Gordon left
us,&#8221; insisted the boy. &#8220;Now you see if I don&#8217;t
wake some Boy Scout up. Here, you carry this
bunch of wood over to that other knoll.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;Perhaps another
jaguar will see the signal and give us a call.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>In a short time the boys had gathered two
great piles of dry leaves and branches lying
some fifty feet apart. Then a quantity of green
boughs were gathered and placed on top of the
dry fuel. When matches were touched to the
piles a dense smoke ascended far above the tops
of the trees. There were two straight columns
of it lifting into the sky above the jungle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; cried Jimmie wiping the sweat
from his face, for the morning was hot and the
work had been arduous, &#8220;if there is a Boy Scout
within ten thousand miles he&#8217;ll know what
those two columns of smoke mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;If he&#8217;s ever been
out camping.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Indian signs adopted by the Boy
Scouts of America one column of smoke means:</p>
<p>&#8220;The camp is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two mean:</p>
<p>&#8220;Help! I am lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three mean:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four mean:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to council.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the dry wood burned away the boys
piled on more, keeping green leaves on top all the
time, to make the smudge. After the fires had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
burned for half an hour a signal came from the
thicket&mdash;a long, shrill whistle to attract attention,
and then a few bars of &#8220;The Star Spangled
Banner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a Boy Scout, all right,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed,
&#8220;but it ain&#8217;t none of our bunch. They
wouldn&#8217;t wait to whistle. They&#8217;d jump right
in an&#8217; tell us where to head in at. You bet they
would.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment a human hand, a slender, boyish
hand, appeared above a great squatty plant
at the foot of the knoll. The thumb and first
finger were extended opened out, the three
remaining fingers closed over the palm of the
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; yelled Jimmie. &#8220;The sign of the
Silver Wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on up,&#8221; cried Peter. &#8220;The appetite
is fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a boyish figure arose from the shelter
of the plant and moved up the hill to where the
boys stood. He was apparently about fifteen
years of age, was dressed as a lad of his age might
appear on Broadway, and presented a fresh,
cheerful face, now wrinkled into smiles, to the
boys waiting with extended hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you signal,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; asked Jimmie, shaking
the extended hand warmly. &#8220;We&#8217;re from
the Black Bear and Wolf Patrols, New York,
and we don&#8217;t know any more about getting along
in the woods than a Houston street mucker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from the Black Bear Patrol of Chicago,&#8221;
the other replied, &#8220;and my name is Anthony
Chester, Tony for short. What you doing in
the Devil&#8217;s Hole?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the Devil&#8217;s Hole?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what they call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Devil seems to be having a good time
of it,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;He&#8217;s had us on the hip all
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were in camp, father and I, about half
way to the cut,&#8221; Tony said, &#8220;and heard your
shots a spell ago. What did you kill?&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly the boys told the story of the night,
and then Peter asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you answer the shots?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were stalking jaguars,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;and did not want to lose our game. The woods
are full of them, for some reason, this spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I guess the ones you got were the ones
we were after.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m glad we got them, for we&#8217;ll divide
the skins with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, a little while ago, I saw your smoke
signal and read it to Dad, and he told me to come
out and bring you to camp for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it cooked?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys fairly danced about their new acquaintance
as they asked questions and rubbed
their stomachs significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All cooked and all ready, plenty of it,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the camp?&#8221; asked Peter, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just a short distance from the Culebra
cut,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Dad came out here some
weeks ago with me and one servant, and we&#8217;re
living in a tent all fixed up with screens and
things. The jaguars aroused us early this morning,
so we got up to shoot them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father workin&#8217; for the Canal people?&#8221;
asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;He takes a great
interest in the Culebra cut, and spends a good
deal of time out there, but he is not working for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the government. He&#8217;s just loafing, and I&#8217;m
having the time of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he go out there nights?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Sanee, the servant, is away nights, and
Dad stays with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind all that now,&#8221; Peter put in.
&#8220;Let us go and see what they&#8217;ve got to eat. I
could devour one of the cats we killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Chester led the way toward the camp
he had spoken of, the boys following, nearly
exhausted from the exertions of the night. It
had been arranged that they should return for
the skins of the two jaguars they had slain.</p>
<p>As they straggled along through the jungle,
Jimmie&#8217;s thoughts were busy over a problem
which had come to his mind during the talk
with the lad who had rescued them. Why was
Mr. Chester, of Chicago, encamped in the jungle,
at the edge, almost, of the Culebra cut, apparently
without other motive than curiosity?</p>
<p>Why did he spend most of his time during
daylight watching the work on the cut, and why
was his servant invariably away from the camp
at night? Were the men watching the work
there for some sinister purpose of their own?
Or was it merely a general interest in the big job
that brought them there?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>The man who had accosted them the previous
evening had been watching the job, too.
Were these men spies, or were they in the service
of the government and watching for spies? It
seemed odd to the boy that every adventure into
which he stumbled had to do with the main
object of the trip to the Canal Zone. Or, at least
all the others had, and this meeting in the
jungle might follow in the train of the others.</p>
<p>He was wondering, too, about the explosion
they had heard early in the morning. At the
time of his leaving the cottage with Lieutenant
Gordon nothing had been decided on concerning
the store of explosives which had been discovered
in the underground chamber at the
ruined temple. He did not believe that Ned
would leave the deadly material there, to be used
at will by the conspirators, so he was wondering
now if the stuff had not been set off by his
friends.</p>
<p>After a hard walk of a mile or more the three
came out to a little clearing in the jungle and
saw a tent with screened openings. Standing in
front of the tent, his face turned toward the
approaching boys, was a man Jimmie had last
seen in the Shaw residence in New York City.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>A MIGHTY JAR IN THE JUNGLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>It was half-past two in the morning when Ned
Nestor and his companions left the cottage in the
jungle. A few fleecy clouds were now drifting
over the sky, but, on the whole, the night was
fairly clear. It was some distance to Gatun,
where Ned hoped to secure a railroad motor for
the Culebra trip, so the boys moved along at a
swift pace.</p>
<p>However, the party was not destined to reach
Gatun as speedily as was anticipated. When
the boys came to the spot from which Ned and
Jimmie had struck off into the jungle, or into the
edge of it, rather, in pursuit of the man who had
placed the bomb, Jack called Ned&#8217;s attention to
two skulking figures moving up the swell of the
hill which the two boys had climbed the night
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some of your friends&mdash;the bomb-makers,&#8221;
Jack said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;they have been in advance
of us for some distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching the cottage, I presume,&#8221; Jack
suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;More likely watching to see if we remained
at home or went abroad planning mischief for
them,&#8221; Ned replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;re next to us,&#8221; Jimmie broke in.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to follow &#8217;em up to the old temple an&#8217;
blow &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea that something of the sort
may happen before morning,&#8221; Ned said. &#8220;I
had the idea that the fellows would remain away
from the bomb-room for a few days, believing
that we were watching it, but it seems that they
are back again. We mustn&#8217;t permit them to take
the stuff away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to blow it up to-night?&#8221; demanded
Jimmie, eagerly. &#8220;Gee, but that will make a
blow-up for your whiskers. Say! I&#8217;d like to
sell tickets of admission for this performance.
That would be poor, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be necessary to blow it up,&#8221; Ned
observed. &#8220;If Lieutenant Gordon sent a couple
of secret service men back there, as arranged, the
fellows have not got into their bomb-chamber.
If the secret service men did not arrive, it is likely
that the plotters are moving the explosives away.
We&#8217;ll go and see, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run on ahead and see what&#8217;s doin&#8217;,&#8221;
Jimmie exclaimed, darting away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Ned caught him by the collar and drew him
back, whereat the boy appeared to be very angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little dunce,&#8221; Ned said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll get a
bullet into your anatomy if you don&#8217;t be more
careful. Now, you boys go on down the road
toward Gatun,&#8221; he added, turning to the others,
&#8220;and make all the noise you want to. I&#8217;ll go up
to the old temple and see what is going on there.
One of you would better go with me&mdash;not close
up with me, but within seeing distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; cried Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay near
enough to see what becomes of you, and go back
and tell the boys if they&#8217;re needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This arrangement was finally decided on, and
Ned and Jimmie dropped into the jungle while
the others proceeded on the way to Gatun, making
plenty of noise as they walked. As they disappeared
the two men who had been seen just
before made their appearance at a point half way
up the hill.</p>
<p>They stood crouching in the moonlight for a
moment, pointing and chattering words which
reached the ears of the watchers only faintly,
and then turned toward the old temple. They
walked with less caution now, and it was plain
to the watchers that they believed that all the
boys had gone on to Gatun.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>When Ned and Jimmie came within sight of
the old temple half a dozen shadowy forms were
seen moving about on the uneven pavements
which had at one time formed the floor of a
court. When the two Ned was following approached
they advanced to meet them.</p>
<p>A conversation lasting perhaps five minutes
followed the meeting, and then, leaving one man
on guard, the others passed through the doorway
under the vines and disappeared from view. The
man who had remained outside was evidently
the leader of the party, for the others had
listened when he talked and had obeyed his
orders, as indicated to Ned by gestures.</p>
<p>This man stood at the doorway behind the
vines for a moment after the others had gone
below and then seated himself on a crumbling
wall not far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you geezle him?&#8221; whispered
Jimmie, who was not staying back very far, much
to Ned&#8217;s amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;I
shall have to circle around so as to get in on him
from behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait a second,&#8221; whispered the boy,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll make him turn around so as to face the
other way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>Before Ned could offer any objections or
restrain the boy&#8217;s hand, Jimmie launched a stone
into the thicket on the other side. The watcher
sprang to his feet instantly, moved away a few
paces, and turned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to call the others,&#8221; Jimmie whispered.</p>
<p>The fellow approached the doorway as
Jimmie spoke, which was exactly what Ned did
not want. If the man would remain outside,
alone, it might be possible to capture him with
little risk. If he called his companions, there
would be no hope of taking him prisoner.</p>
<p>Ned motioned to Jimmie and the lad threw
another stone into the thicket, and again the
watcher moved in that direction. This time he
advanced to the edge of the thicket and bent
over to peer under the overhanging branches of
a tree.</p>
<p>Before he could regain an upright position,
or give a cry of warning because of the quick
steps he heard behind him, Ned was grappling
with him, his fingers closing about the muscular
throat. It was a desperate, although a silent,
struggle for a minute, and Ned might have been
disappointed in the result if Jimmie had not
bounced in on the two and terminated the battle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
by sitting down on the head of the man Ned
had already thrown to the ground. As an additional
precaution against any noise calculated
to alarm the others, Jimmie held his gun close
to the captive&#8217;s nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; stirrin&#8217; here,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;You
lie still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were English and the voice was
certainly that of a man from one of the Eastern
states of the North American republic.</p>
<p>Ned drew a noose around the prisoner&#8217;s
wrists and tied his rather delicate hands together
firmly behind his back. Then he searched him
for weapons. A revolver was found in a hip
pocket, also a package of papers in a breast
pocket. The fellow cursed and swore like a
pirate when the papers were taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is highway robbery,&#8221; he finally calmed
down enough to say. &#8220;I am an official of the
Zone, and you shall suffer for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; said Jimmie, with a chuckle, &#8220;you
must have a contract to lift the canal an&#8217; the
Gatun dam into the blue sky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner snarled at the lad a moment
and turned to Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are your men doing down there?&#8221;
Ned asked, ignoring the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are removing explosives, explosives
to be used in the work at Gatun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it stored here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were your men storing this bomb,&#8221; taking
the clumsy exhibit from his pocket, &#8220;under my
cottage for safety?&#8221; Ned demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Return my papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of returning them, Ned took the
packet from his pocket and made a quick examination
so far as the light would permit, of the
half dozen letters it held.</p>
<p>The captive writhed about and cursed fluently
until Jimmie touched his forehead with
the muzzle of his gun and warned him against
&#8220;starting anything he couldn&#8217;t finish,&#8221; as the
boy expressed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Ned said to Jimmie, restoring the
letters to his pocket, &#8220;you march this pirate off
toward the cottage while I scare the others out
of the bomb-room and blow it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow it up before they get out,&#8221; urged the
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no executioner,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
doubtless deserve to be put to death, but I&#8217;m
not the one to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said the captive, as Jimmie motioned
him away. &#8220;If you will give me a chance
to tell my side of the story those letters reveal,
I may be able to establish my innocence. I can
make it worth your while to listen to me,&#8221; he
added, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cripes, I smell money,&#8221; laughed Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on with the boy,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;If
you want to talk with me you may do so later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn you over to the Zone government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive would have argued until his
friends came out and sized up the situation, and
Ned knew it, so he motioned Jimmie to march
the fellow away and set about the work he had
in hand. He took out the bomb he had brought
with him and estimated the length of time the
fuse would burn. It was, as has been said, a
very long fuse, and the boy was satisfied that he
could escape from the danger zone after firing it.</p>
<p>Then, seeing that Jimmie was out of view
with his prisoner, he brought out his gun and fired
two shots into the air. The result showed that
he had planned with judgment, for the men
working below came bounding out of the doorway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
behind the vines and vanished in the
jungle, going in a direction opposite to that taken
by Jimmie.</p>
<p>The rapidity with which the workers in the
bomb-room disappeared astonished Ned until
he reflected that he might unconsciously have
given a signal agreed upon between the men and
the guard. At any rate, he finally concluded,
the men were not there to fight in defense of the
place if spied upon, but to seek cover at once, as
is the habit of those caught in the commission of
crime.</p>
<p>He had expected to drive them away by firing
from the jungle, but had not anticipated a victory
as easily won as this. When the workers
had disappeared Ned made his way to the underground
room. There he found torches burning,
and a fire in the forge. The place was littered
with gas-pipe cut into small lengths, and the
covers had been removed from the tins of explosives.</p>
<p>It was clear that the bomb-makers had been
at work there, and the boy wondered at their
nerve. He could account for their returning
to their employment there so soon after the
place had been visited by hostile interests only
on the ground that they believed the secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
service men and the boys were being held at bay
by others of the conspirators.</p>
<p>Wondering whether the boys who had gone
on toward Gatun were safe, he lighted the fuse
of the bomb and hastened up the stairs and out
into the jungle. A few yards from the broken
wall of the temple he met Jimmie, red of face and
laboring under great excitement. He turned
the boy back with a significant gesture toward
the temple, and the two worked their way
through the thickets for some moments without
finding time or breath for explanations.</p>
<p>When at last they stopped for breath they
found themselves about at the point where they
had parted from their chums. As they came into
the cleared space a flash lighted up the sky,
flames went flickering, seemingly, from horizon
to horizon, and lifted to the zenith. Then came
the awful thunder of the explosion. The ground
shook so that Jimmie went tumbling on his face.
After the first mighty explosion others came in
quick succession.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the little ones,&#8221; Jimmie cried,
rolling over in the knee-deep grass to clutch at
Ned&#8217;s knee. &#8220;Talk about your fourth of July.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke a slab of stone weighing at least
twenty pounds came through the air with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
vicious whizz and struck a tree close to where
the boy lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get out of here we&#8217;ll get our
blocks knocked off,&#8221; Jimmie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shower is over,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;What
were you running back for? If you had not met
me, if I had gone out another way, you might
have been right there when the explosion took
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been sailin&#8217; around the moon
by now,&#8221; the boy grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the captive?&#8221; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went up in the air,&#8221; replied Jimmie. &#8220;I
had me eagle eyes on him one second, and the
next second he was gone. He didn&#8217;t shout, or
shoot, or run, or do a consarned thing. He
just leaked out. Where do you think he went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;that you were looking
back to see the explosion and he dodged into
a thicket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; admitted Jimmie, &#8220;I did look back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned, rather disgusted at the carelessness of
the boy, walked on in silence until the two came
to the smooth slopes which led up to Gatun.
There they found the boys, waiting for them,
eager for the story of the explosion, and wondering
at their long delay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE WATCHER IN THE THICKET.</h3>
</div>

<p>Between Tabernilla and Gamboa, a distance
of about fifteen miles, the restless Chagres river,
in its old days of freedom, crossed the canal line
no less than fifteen times. At Gamboa the river
finds a break in the rough hills and winds off to
the northeast, past Las Cruces and off into more
hills and jungles.</p>
<p>Where the river turns the canal enters the
nine-mile cut through the Cordilleras, which form
the backbone of the continent. Here at the
Culebra cut, the greatest amount of excavation
for the waterway is being done. This cut ends
at Pedro Miguel locks, which will ease the ships
down into the Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>Where the river turns to the northeast, at
Gamboa, a wild and hilly country forms both
banks. The hillsides as well as the plateaux
are overgrown with dense vegetation. As in all
tropical lands, the fight for survival is fierce
and merciless. Trees are destroyed by great
creepers, great creepers are destroyed by smaller
growths, and every form of life, vegetable as well
as animal, has its enemy. Every living thing
springs up from the dead body of another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Sheltered and half concealed from view in
this wild country between Gamboa and Las
Cruces, on the day the Boy Scouts set out in their
search for Jimmie and Peter, there stood a house
of stone which seemed as old as the volcanic formation
upon which it stood. It was said that the
structure had been there, even then looking old
and dismantled, when the French began their
operations on the Isthmus.</p>
<p>This house faced the valley of the Chagres
river, having its back against a hill, which was
one of the steps leading up to the top of the
Cordilleras. There was a great front entrance
way, and many windows, but the latter seemed
closed. Few signs of life were seen about the
place at five o&#8217;clock that afternoon.</p>
<p>From a front room in the second story the
sounds of voices came, and now and then a door
opened and closed and a footstep was heard
on the stairway. However, those who walked
about the place seemed either going or coming,
for the house gained no added population because
of the men who climbed the slope at the front
and, ignoring the main entrance, passed on to the
second floor by a secret staircase in the wall,
entrance to which seemed easy for them to find.</p>
<p>At the hour named three acquaintances of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
the reader occupied the front room on the second
floor of the stone house. They were Col. Van
Ellis, the military man Frank Shaw had talked
with in the old house near the Culebra cut,
Harvey Chester, the father of the boy Jimmie
and Peter had encountered in the jungle, and
Gostel, the man who had approached the two
boys the night before on the lip of the great
excavation.</p>
<p>In a rear apartment, a sort of lumber-room,
devoted now to wornout and broken furniture
and odds and ends of house furnishing goods,
was still another acquaintance&mdash;Ned Nestor.
The patrol leader had met the two lost boys at
Culebra, in the company of Harvey Chester and
his son, Tony, and had spent enough time with
the party to learn that Pedro, the ex-servant of
the Shaw home, had been seen at the Chester
camp, and that he had fled at the approach of
Jimmie and his chum.</p>
<p>The story of Gostel&#8217;s watching the cut at
night, probably assisted by Pedro, and Harvey
Chester standing guard, or seeming to do so, by
day, had interested Ned greatly. The presence
on the Isthmus of Pedro gave an extra kink to
the problem. The attempt to capture the two
boys, as previously told by Gastong, on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
previous night, and the unmistakable anxiety of
Chester to remain in their company, had led Ned
to believe that at last he was getting to some of
the people &#8220;high up&#8221; in the conspiracy against
the canal. Surely a man of the education and
evident wealth of Harvey Chester was not loitering
along the Culebra cut just for the excitement
there was in it. It was plain that he was there
for a purpose, and the arrival of a man Jimmie
declared to be Gostel had convinced Ned that
the heads of the plot were not far away.</p>
<p>Gostel had greeted the boys heartily, expressing
relief at the knowledge that they had
escaped in safety from the jungle, and Chester
had urged them all to accept of his continued
hospitality. Nothing had been said of Gostel&#8217;s
pursuit of the two boys, and Ned had reached
the conclusion that Gostel did not know that
his movements had been observed.</p>
<p>Anxious to see what Gostel really was up to,
Ned had instructed the boys to remain at a hotel
at Culebra or visit the Chester camp, just as
they saw fit, and had followed Gostel back to
Gamboa and out to the stone house, where he
had managed to hide himself in the room above
described without his presence on the premises
being suspected. One thing, however, Ned did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
not know, and that was that Jimmie McGraw,
full of life and curious to know what was going
on, had trained on after him and was now watching
the house from a thicket on the hillside.</p>
<p>Ned had heard a good deal of talk since hiding
himself in the rear room, much of which was
of no account. Men who had delivered notes
and messages had come and gone. Col. Van
Ellis seemed to be doing a general business there.
Some of the men who came appeared to be canal
workmen, and these left what seemed to be
reports of some kind.</p>
<p>From a break in the wall Ned could hear all
that was said and see a great deal of what went
on in the front room. At five o&#8217;clock a tall,
dark, slender man whose black hair was turning
gray in places entered the front room by way of
the secret stairway in the side wall. He handed
some papers to Col. Van Ellis and seated himself
without being asked to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, as a whole, are the indications?&#8221;
Van Ellis asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; was the short reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the latest prospect?&#8221; asked Chester.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the valley, near Bohio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you found there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay-slate, hornblende, emeralds.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In large quantities?&#8221; asked Chester, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a fortune underground there,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;Green argillaceous rock means
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for some moments, during
which Van Ellis pored over some drawings on
his desk, Chester walked the floor excitedly,
Gostel regarded the others with a sinister smile
on his face, and Itto, the recent arrival, sat
watching all the others as a cat watches a mouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this territory will be under the Lake
of Gatun?&#8221; Chester asked, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very deep under the Lake of Gatun,&#8221;
was Itto&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>Again Van Ellis bent over the drawings,
tracing on one with the point of a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are millions here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
have only to stretch forth our hands and take
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wealth of a world,&#8221; Itto observed.</p>
<p>The men talked together in Spanish for a
long time, and Ned tried hard to make something
of the discussion, but failed. He was convinced,
however, that Chester was being urged
and argued with by the others and was not
consenting to what they were proposing to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>In half an hour a man who looked fully as
Oriental in size, manner and dress as Itto stepped
inside the door and beckoned to that gentleman.
Asking permission to retire for a few moments,
Itto passed out of the door with the newcomer.
Instead of going on down the secret staircase,
however, the two opened a door at the end of
the little hall upon which the front room gave,
and appeared in the apartment where Ned was
hiding.</p>
<p>The boy, however, was not in view from the
place where they stood, and they had no reason
to suspect his presence there, so he remained
quiet and listened with all his ears to the low-voiced
conversation carried on between the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;And these are the latest?&#8221; Itto asked, referring
to papers in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the showing&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomer shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see for yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Itto said, directly, &#8220;it does not
matter, does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the information does not leak out,&#8221; Itto
went on, &#8220;there will be no change in our plans.
We cannot afford to wait.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For our country&#8217;s sake there must be no
delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned was slowly piecing this talk with the one
which he had heard from the front room, and
the significance of it all was sending little shivers
down his back. He thought he understood at
last.</p>
<p>As the two men left the room Ned heard a
paper rustle on the floor, and at once made
search for it. It was a drawing, similar to the
one discovered in the bomb-room at the old temple,
and was a complete sketch of the Gatun
dam, the spillway, the locks&mdash;everything was
shown, with character of fills and suggestions
regarding the foundations. Here and there on
the drawing were little red spots.</p>
<p>The significance of the red marks brought a
date to Ned&#8217;s mind. The drawings found in the
bomb-room had borne a date, Saturday, April
15. If what he surmised was correct, he had
only a little more than twenty-four hours in
which to work. In the period of time thus given
him he might, without doubt, succeed in averting
the destruction of the big dam. But that
was not the point.</p>
<p>His business there was not only to protect the
Gatun dam but also to get to the core of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
conspiracy and bring the plotters to punishment.
The men who were plotting on the Isthmus were
also plotting in New York. An inkling of the
true state of affairs came to him, and he saw
that in order to accomplish what he had set out
to do his reach must be long enough to stretch
across the Atlantic and there grapple with the
subordinates in the treacherous plot.</p>
<p>Itto returned to the front room when the
newcomer left and again the talk and the arguments
went on, sometimes in Spanish, sometimes
in English. Mr. Chester seemed to be asking for
more time. Presently the date Ned had found
on the two drawings was mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time set was Saturday&mdash;to-morrow,&#8221;
Itto said, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was decided upon a long time ago,&#8221;
Van Ellis said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the New York complications arose,&#8221;
Chester argued. &#8220;We did not know at that
time what complications might result from the
defection of one of our number. It is injudicious
to go on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The date referred to was also set for action
in New York,&#8221; Itto said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the thing is inadvisable now, for
Shaw has been warned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>It was plain to Ned that he would have to
get away from the old stone house and decide
upon some effective means of meeting this emergency.
He had work to do in New York as well
as in Gatun. The drawing found in the bomb-chamber
had told him that. Now this new information
emphasized the demand for instant
action.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in his mind that it was
the purpose of the plotters to blow up the great
dam on the next day, probably after nightfall.
As has been said, he could thwart the plans of
the traitors by communicating with the secret
service men under Lieutenant Gordon, but that
course would not be apt to bring about all the
desired results. He wanted to arrest every man
connected with the plot. Not only that; he
wanted proof to convict every one of them.</p>
<p>There seemed to the boy only one way in
which he could attain the results sought for.
He must catch the plotters &#8220;with the goods on,&#8221;
as the police say. He must catch them with
explosives in their hands under the shadow of
the dam! Ned knew that Harvey, Van Ellis,
Gostel, and Itto were deep in the treacherous
game, but he did not know how many others
were taking part in it. He suspected that men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
high up in finance were back of the plot, and
wanted to get the whole group.</p>
<p>He thought he knew why Harvey, Van Ellis
and some of the others were in the plot. He was
quite certain that he did. But he was not
so certain of the motives of Itto, the Japanese.
They might never be revealed unless the game
was checked at the right moment.</p>
<p>There was an air of insincerity about the
Japanese which Ned did not like. It seemed to
the boy that he was leading the others on&mdash;or
trying to lead them on&mdash;in a sinister way. The
impression was in the lad&#8217;s mind from the moment
of his meeting Gostel that the two men,
Itto and Gostel, were in the plot for some purpose
of their own, a purpose which was not
the accumulation of money, and which did not
match the motives of the others.</p>
<p>About six o&#8217;clock Chester arose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back to camp,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a meeting to-night,&#8221; Van Ellis
urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;An important one,&#8221; Gostel put in.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a midnight visit to the dam,&#8221; Itto said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a previous engagement at the camp,&#8221;
Harvey insisted. &#8220;We have guests from New
York, my son and myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The secret service lads,&#8221; exclaimed Gostel,
scornfully. &#8220;Leave them to me to-night, and
you can then keep your engagement with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my doubts about their being connected
with the secret service,&#8221; Chester replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are positive,&#8221; Gostel said. &#8220;They
were followed from New York. We know the
plotting that has been going on between Gordon
and Nestor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much more concerning the boys was said,
but Ned was too anxious to get away to pay full
attention to it. Another burden was now on his
mind. He must see that the boys were warned
and came to no harm.</p>
<p>He had left them with the understanding
that they might remain at the Culebra hotel or
return with Tony Chester to the cottage where
they had been taken when brought out of the
jungle. If they had returned to the camp, they
might already be in great danger.</p>
<p>Chester insisted on taking his departure,
and the others accompanied him to the foot of
the stairs in the wall, arguing with him every
foot of the way. Ned stood at the door of the
rear room when they returned, and while they
were getting settled in the front apartment he
slipped out and moved cautiously down the steps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>When he gained the grounds outside he
dodged into a thicket not ten feet away from the
exit and waited to make sure that no one was
moving about on the outside. He was anxious
to get away from the place without his presence
there being known. A struggle, even if he succeeded
in getting away, would put the plotters
on their guard.</p>
<p>In a few moments he realized that the
grounds were not so devoid of human life as he
had believed. He heard voices on the side toward
the hill, and a rustling in the thicket told
him that some one was stealthily moving there.</p>
<p>Knowing that it would be dark in a short
tune, Ned remained crouched low in the bushes,
hoping to escape detection in that way, but footsteps
came closer and closer to his hiding place,
and he sprang up just in time to see a lithe figure
hurtling toward him, the figure of a tall, slender
man with an Oriental cast of countenance.</p>
<p>Glad that there was only one, Ned braced
himself for the attack, which, however, did not
come. When within a yard of its object, the
lithe figure turned, staggered forward, uttered
a low cry of anger and surprise, and lay swathed
in a cluster of vines which had tripped and now
held him to the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>JIMMIE RELEASES A PRISONER.</h3>
</div>

<p>Realizing that the man who had attacked
him, or attempted to, must not escape or be permitted
to utter a cry of warning, Ned sprang
forward and caught him by the throat. The
fallen man squirmed about in the thicket for a
moment and then feebly motioned for Ned to
remove the pressure from his neck.</p>
<p>Then the patrol leader saw that the fellow
had been lassoed, caught about the neck by a
running noose in a slender rope. This accounted
for his antics when first observed by the boy.
Puzzled beyond measure, Ned loosened the noose
so the captive would not die from lack of air.</p>
<p>The man sat up in the tangle of bushes,
pressing his hands to his neck and rocking to and
fro with pain. It was plain that the rope which
had caught him had been drawn by a merciless
hand. But whose hand was it? Ned was
greatly interested in that question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have released the rope so as to give you
a little longer lease of life,&#8221; Ned said to the
prisoner, &#8220;but if you try to call out for help, or
to escape, you&#8217;ll be killed. Do you understand?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Ned shifted the noose to the man&#8217;s wrists,
which were fastened behind his back, and relieved
him of a revolver and a wicked-looking
knife. Then he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you watching me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the short reply, in good English.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew that I was in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I saw you go in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the others know that I was in there?&#8221;
asked Ned, then, anxiously.</p>
<p>If the others knew, then all his plans must be
revised.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came the reply. &#8220;I had had no
opportunity of telling them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were placed on guard here by the man
called Gostel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who was it that pulled you down?
There is something strange about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw no one,&#8221; replied the other, feeling of
his throat again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were others watching here with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who did it?&#8221; demanded Ned. &#8220;That
rope never dropped down from the clouds and
brought you up so cleverly. Why, man, you
would have had a knife into me in a second only
for the rope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped to,&#8221; was the calm reply.</p>
<p>Then Ned heard a giggle in the thicket, and
in a moment the vines parted and Jimmie looked
out, a shrewd smile on his freckled face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you follow the line to the end?&#8221;
he asked, with a chuckle. &#8220;Then you would
have come to the life saver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so rattled for a moment that I did not
think of that,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;How did you
come to be here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I followed you,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have been lying out there in the
thicket all the time I have been in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did a good job,&#8221; Ned said, taking
the boy by the hand. &#8220;The cowboy stunt you
have been practicing so long came into good use
at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now getting quite dark, and lights
showed in the house. From where the boys
stood they could not see the lighted front windows,
but only the reflections on the slope in
front of the structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it would prove handy in time,&#8221;
grinned Jimmie. &#8220;I caught this gazabo on the
fly, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand how you managed it,
in this thicket,&#8221; Ned said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a clear space there where he leaped
at you,&#8221; Jimmie said. &#8220;I saw him rising to
spring and dropped it over his head, like a bag
over a blind pig. What you goin&#8217; to do with
him, now you&#8217;ve got him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned turned to the prisoner with a smile on
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you suggest?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! You&#8217;ve got your nerve,&#8221; Jimmie
exclaimed. &#8220;Leave it to him an&#8217; you&#8217;ll fill his
pocket with yellow ones an&#8217; turn him loose to
carve you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you release me,&#8221; the captive replied,
evidently taking the question in good faith, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
leave the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that on the square?&#8221; demanded Jimmie,
with a grin at Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a condition, however,&#8221; the man
added, &#8220;and that is that you make it appear that
I was killed in defending the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221; asked Jimmie, while
Ned stood by wondering if he had not struck a
lead of good luck at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of the game,&#8221; the prisoner replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not in it for money, anyway, and the other
motive is no longer of avail to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll tell me everything you know concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
this plot against the Gatun dam,&#8221; Ned
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll release you after the case is ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; replied the other, closing his
lips tightly, as if to shut back words seeking
utterance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to find a little coop to put
you in,&#8221; Jimmie said. &#8220;I wish we had you back
at Culebra.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the temporary disposition of the prisoner
was being discussed, and while Ned was
questioning him as to the immediate movements
of the plotters and receiving no satisfactory
replies, the lights in the house were extinguished
and the men who had occupied the front room
were heard descending the stairs. In a moment
some one called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your name?&#8221; demanded Ned of the
prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then answer him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaga did not respond at once, and the keen
point of a knife came in contact with his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The call came again, farther away now.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say?&#8221; asked the captive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer him as you would have answered if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
nothing had happened to you here,&#8221; was the
reply.</p>
<p>The prisoner uttered a long, low cry, and the
boys waited with suspended breath. Even at
the peril of his life the fellow might warn the
others. Ned knew how loyal the people of his
nation are.</p>
<p>But the reply was not a warning, or a call for
help. The man who had called out the prisoner&#8217;s
name answered now with an &#8220;All right.
Remain about here.&#8221; Then the men moved
away in a body, taking the road to Gamboa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they coming back to-night?&#8221; asked
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you nothing,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>When the men who had left the house had
disappeared from sight Ned bade the captive rise
that he might be searched closely for weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; Jimmie cried. &#8220;There&#8217;s your tall,
slender man with black hair turning gray in
places. Ever in New York, Mister?&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The prisoner made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are enough like Itto to be his brother,&#8221;
Ned said. &#8220;Perhaps you won&#8217;t mind telling me
which one of you stole Frank Shaw&#8217;s necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner turned his back indignantly.
He was indeed a fair copy of the man called Itto,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
and his shoulders, narrow and high, might have
made the damp stains Ned had found on the
wall of the closet in the Shaw house in New York.</p>
<p>The stone house was now, seemingly, without
an occupant and the thickets about were
silent save for the noises of the night. A faint
clamor came from the canal, where workmen
were hewing away at the ribs of the Cordilleras,
now the slight jar of an explosion, now the
grinding of a steam shovel, now the nervous
shrieking of the trains pushing back and forth.</p>
<p>The electrics over the cut drew lines of silver
light on the tall trees and the foliage of the hills
farther away, but here there was only a faint
suggestion of illumination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; Jimmie said, presently,
&#8220;what you goin&#8217; to do with him? We
can&#8217;t get him to Culebra or Gatun without
bumpin&#8217; into some fresh guy who would want
to take him away from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re right about that,&#8221; Ned
said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to have him get away
and inform his companions that something of
their plot is known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make new plans, and we should have to
begin all over again. As the case rests now we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
stand a good chance of catching every one of the
conspirators.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the chap that stole the emerald necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the necklace may drift to the surface
in the eruption which is sure to take place in the
near future,&#8221; smiled Ned. &#8220;Now about Gaga,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;Suppose you look around and
see if you can&#8217;t find a room in the old house which
would not be used to-night, even if the plotters
should come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie hustled away and soon returned with
the information that there was a room in the
rear of the house, on the first floor, which would
answer for a prison very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there ain&#8217;t no door to it,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;an&#8217; the glass is all out of the window. Looks
like it had been deserted for a hundred years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can rig up a door,&#8221; suggested
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; asked Jimmie. &#8220;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to stay right here with the captive until
the secret service men come an&#8217; take him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will not come until the case is
ended,&#8221; urged Ned. &#8220;The knowledge that
Gaga is a prisoner&mdash;arrested by a spy who overheard
what was said in the house&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call myself a spy,&#8221; Jimmie said,
indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no dishonor in serving as a spy in
a good cause,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;As I was saying,
the mere knowledge of his arrest would disarrange
our plans as much as his escape would.
We would better make him secure here and leave
him to his own thoughts, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to have him remain,&#8221; said
Gaga, much to the amazement of the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t resist my winnin&#8217; ways,&#8221; cried
Jimmie. &#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll stay if you will send
out about a ton of grub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the boys will object to bringing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, or Frank, or any one of them,&#8221; Jimmie
exclaimed. &#8220;No trouble about that. Perhaps
it will take two to bring enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner&#8217;s bonds were loosened so that
he would not feel them drawing into the flesh,
but still he was left securely tied up. The room
was not unpleasant, with the starlight shining in
through the dismantled doorway and the broken
window, and Jimmie planned to have a good rest
there during his watch.</p>
<p>The boy had been on his feet all the previous
night, wandering about the jungle, and had taken
only a short rest at the Chester camp. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
prisoner was so secured that it did not seem
possible for him to get away, even if left there
alone, so the lad rolled a dilapidated old easy
chair up to the window and lay back at his ease.</p>
<p>For a long time neither spoke, and then the
prisoner asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;When will I be taken to prison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me!&#8221; Jimmie replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it,&#8221; the captive continued, &#8220;that the
whole plot is discovered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet your life!&#8221; Jimmie answered, drowsily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the United States government will
have to put up a couple of extra prisons,&#8221; was
the comment of the prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; it for?&#8221; demanded the boy.</p>
<p>The prisoner did not see fit to reply to this
leading question, and Jimmie put another,
equally pertinent:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who let you into the Shaw house that
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think I was in the Shaw
house?&#8221; asked the other. &#8220;Where is the Shaw
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know where it is, all right,&#8221; Jimmie
said. &#8220;Who was it that let you in? That is
what I want to know. An&#8217; who opened the door
for you to go out?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>There was no reply, and Jimmie piled on
another question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did Pedro run away from Shaw&#8217;s and
why did he run away from Chester&#8217;s camp when
he saw me coming from the jungle?&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner gave a quick start, and something
like a groan came from his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Pedrarias, the man you call Pedro, here
on the Isthmus?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he is. Didn&#8217;t he report to you after
he got here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Living at the Chester camp, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was there this morning, but ran away
when he recognized me. I was at the Shaw
house in New York on the night of the robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner checked a Spanish oath and
struggled to rise to his feet, but fell back into his
chair because of his bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is bad blood between this man and
myself,&#8221; he said, then. &#8220;If he saw me with
Chester to-day he will present himself here to-night.
If he comes and finds me a prisoner,
bound and at his mercy&mdash;if he comes here to-night,
and finds us in this room, and you are
unable to deal with him, will you cut my bonds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And permit you to run away together and
give me the laugh?&#8221; said Jimmie. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
modest kind of a fellow after all, and with nerve
to spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do this,&#8221; Gaga replied, &#8220;I promise
to return to you and submit to be bound again,
if I come out of the conflict alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Pedro would murder an unarmed
man, and a bound one, at that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the hatred he has for me is so great
that he would take any advantage of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie was getting the notion that there
was something tragic in the air, and was even
considering the proposition seriously when there
was a movement at the open doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he comes here,&#8221; Gaga went on, &#8220;you
must either kill him yourself or let me. He
will spare neither of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy was listening for a repetition of the
sound at the doorway, when a form lifted from
the crumbling threshold and stood peering in.
Gaga gave a cry of terror and the intruder drew
back for an instant.</p>
<p>The boy knew that the man whose figure he
had seen outlined against the star-sprinkled sky
was the man he had seen standing by the couch
of the owner of the <i>Daily Planet</i> on the night
of the robbery, the man he had seen later in the
Chester camp in the jungle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of Heaven!&#8221; the prisoner
whispered.</p>
<p>The entreaty struck home to the heart of the
boy. He had always prided himself on his love
of fair play. He knew that he could not successfully
defend the doorless, windowless room
until the arrival of his friends, or the return of
the plotters. Pedro could hide in the thicket
and rain bullets upon himself and the prisoner
until both were killed.</p>
<p>He could not make his own escape and leave
the prisoner bound and at the mercy of his
enemy, nor could he shoot the intruder in cold
blood when he appeared in the doorway again.
He was only a boy, and his inherent love of a
square deal conquered.</p>
<p>While the movements at the door continued,
he slipped over to Gaga, ran his knife through
the cords which bound him, pointed to the
weapons which had been taken from him, and
crouched down in a corner of the room, his heart
beating like a trip-hammer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>A GUARDIAN NEEDING GUARDING.</h3>
</div>

<p>Little realizing the danger in which Jimmie
had been left, Ned made what speed he could to
Gamboa and there looked about for some means
of reaching Culebra without delay. It seemed
important that he should reach the other members
of his party as soon as possible and send
one of the boys back to keep watch with Jimmie.</p>
<p>Besides, it was his intention to communicate
with Lieutenant Gordon immediately. He did
not expect the lieutenant to call out a squad of
secret service men and place the big dam under
guard. That, he reasoned, would defeat his
plans for rounding up the plotters. However, it
was his duty to report progress to the officer and
consult with him concerning future movements.</p>
<p>At Gamboa he found a telephone and called
the Tivoli at Ancon, but, to his disgust, Lieutenant
Gordon could not be found. He tried
the offices of several engineers and canal officials
with no better result. At last, exhibiting a
secret service badge which had been given him by
the lieutenant, he mounted an engine about to
leave for Culebra and was soon in that beautiful
city.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>The boys were at the hotel where he had left
them, having declined the repeated offers of
hospitality by Mr. Chester, and Tony was with
them. A session was at once held in a private
room, and Jack Bosworth and Harry Stevens
jumped at the chance to load themselves with
provisions and travel back to the stone house
east of Gamboa. They were given the needed
directions and sent away with a note to an officer
of the railroad, who, it may be as well to state
here, landed them at Gamboa in quick time and
without asking any questions.</p>
<p>After the boys had taken their departure
Frank Shaw called Ned aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something doing here to-night,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Mr. Chester came out of the parlor as
red as a lobster, about six o&#8217;clock, and I guess
he had a fight with a couple of Japs, Gostel
and another chap I&#8217;ve never seen before. They
parted courteously, but I could see that Tony&#8217;s
father was angry clear through. After he had
gone back to his camp, or started for it, the Japs
got a little crowd of gabbers about them and set
off down the road toward Colon. They seemed
mighty pleased over something, and I guess
they&#8217;re going to start something to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the other man, this Col. Van Ellis.
Did he come here with Chester?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he was here, but I took good care
that he did not see me. I think he went away
with Chester. They were both very angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angry at the Japanese?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; anyway, they disagreed over something.
But while the two white men were
angry, the Japs seemed pleased. I&#8217;ll tell you
what I think, Ned. The Japs are up to something
the others do not like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned was beginning to see a great light. Once
before, since seeing Gostel, he had studied out
the problem of the sincerity of the man, and had
reached the conclusion that he was using Chester&mdash;perhaps
others&mdash;for some sinister purpose
of his own. Now he thought he saw the plot
in its true light. However, he did not communicate
his thoughts to the others. Had Gordon
been at hand he would have confided the story
to him. But Gordon was not at the Tivoli at
Ancon and no one seemed to know where he was,
so he was obliged to go ahead and exercise his
own best judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s doing to-night?&#8221; Glen Howard
asked, when Ned and Frank returned to the
room where the other boys were seated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to Gatun,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going on a special engine, and we&#8217;re to
leave the tracks in the outskirts and get down to
the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is not the night,&#8221; Frank said,
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;The date on the drawings was that of to-morrow,
Saturday,&#8221; said Glen. &#8220;This is Friday.
Of course you know what you are doing, but
I wouldn&#8217;t take any chances on flushing the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; demanded Tony
Chester. &#8220;There seems to be something in the
air to-night. Father went away in a grouch and
told me to remain with you boys, and Gastong
is wandering about the city in a half-distracted
manner. If you go to Gatun may I go with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned pondered a moment before replying.
There was in his mind the thought that this boy
might work a miracle for his father. He saw
one chance for saving Chester from the results
of his connection with the plotters, and resolved
to take it, risky to his plans though it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, in a moment, &#8220;you are to go
to your camp with a note for your father. After
you deliver the note, you are to come back here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
and remain until you hear from me. If your
father comes with you, so much the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he tell me what is in the note&mdash;why he
comes back to the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;If he
does come, tell him to remain close to a &#8217;phone,
here, for I may want to talk with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand what all this mystery is
about,&#8221; Tony exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you see Gastong last?&#8221; asked
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, about half an hour ago. He was in the
hotel then, flying around like a hen minus her
head. He asked for you, and said he&#8217;d be in
the buffet when you came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned lost no time in getting to the buffet,
where he found Gastong, sitting in conversation
with a trampish-looking fellow who seemed
to be somewhat under the influence of liquor.
He beckoned to Ned when he entered the room
and made room for him on the leather rest at his
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Tommy, the cook,&#8221; he said, when
Ned was seated. &#8220;Your cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to join the force,&#8221; laughed Ned.
&#8220;I never would have known you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Gordon told me to keep watch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
of you boys,&#8221; laughed Tommy, &#8220;but I reckon
you&#8217;re doing pretty well for yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a secret service man?&#8221; asked Ned,
satisfied now that Gordon had indeed thought it
necessary to keep them all under surveillance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Tommy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
much of a cook. I guess you found that out up
at the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was thoughtful of the lieutenant,&#8221; Ned
said, &#8220;but, as you say, we seem to be getting
on very well. Do you happen to know where
Gordon is at the present moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was to meet me here,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;but has not shown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is dollars to apples,&#8221; said Gastong, &#8220;that
the Japs have cornered him. He told me, on the
night you went after the bomb-man, that some
one was sleuthing him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that you knew him,&#8221; Ned
said, wondering if every person he had come
upon since arriving on the Isthmus was in the
secret service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gastong, &#8220;Lieutenant Gordon
was on the squad here, you know, before he
went to Mexico, and I used to meet him now and
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he told you, on the first night of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
arrival at camp, that we might need looking
after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he told me that it would do no harm
to let him know if I saw a mob of New York boys
wandering about the works,&#8221; laughed Gastong.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that is how you happened to be patrolling
the Culebra cut in a motor car on the day the
boys ran into Col. Van Ellis at the old house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Gastong, &#8220;Tommy, here, kept
me posted in a way, and I thought I might be
useful out that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clever of the lieutenant,&#8221; laughed
Ned. &#8220;Suppose you now turn your attention to
him? He may need the help of the Boy Scouts
to get out of a hole himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you could help him, all right,&#8221;
Gastong replied, confidently, but still with a
look of anxiety on his face. &#8220;He has a heap of
confidence in you, Mr. Nestor, but he thought
best to take every precaution for your welfare.
That is the reason why he surrounded you, as far
as possible, with secret service people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned was more than amused at the statement,
for all the discoveries that had been made
had resulted from the activities of the boys and
himself. In fact, the only help Gordon&#8217;s chain
of secret service men had given his party was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
thwarting of the plans of Van Ellis at the old
house.</p>
<p>This had been important, in a sense, as the
boys would otherwise have been held prisoners
there and so would not have been able to come
to the rescue of Ned and Jimmie at the old
temple. Still, Jack Bosworth had been in that
incident, and it was a question in the mind of
the patrol leader if the result would have been
the same without him. However, he gave the
lieutenant full credit for his cautious way of
going at the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Japs, as you call them,&#8221; he said to Gastong
and Tommy, &#8220;have gone on toward Colon.
I&#8217;m going on after them, but it may be well for
you to remain here on the chance of meeting the
lieutenant. He may have plans of his own for
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he has,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;He has
been active all day, with half a dozen men going
and coming under his orders. He missed you
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a date to view the scenery up the
Chagres river,&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>
<p>The patrol leader went back to the room
where he had left Frank, George, Glen, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Peter. Tony had left for his father&#8217;s camp and
George Tolford had gone with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give considerable to know what
Chester and the Japs, as they are called, quarreled
about to-night,&#8221; he said, but of course the boys
could give him no information on the subject.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Ned thought he knew,
but the thing was so incomprehensible to him
that he doubted, for a time, his own reasoning.
It was now nine o&#8217;clock, and it seemed to him
that the time for action had come. Whether
he was right in his deductions or not, he could
not afford to ignore the plans he had made for
the night. He did not like the idea of accepting
responsibility for the important move he was
determined to make, but Lieutenant Gordon
was not to be found, and there was nothing for
him to do but to go ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; he said to his chums, &#8220;we are
going into a game to-night that may lead to
bloodshed. Again, it may prove a farce. I
have only my own judgment to go on, but the
matter is so serious that I&#8217;m going to take a
risk. I should prefer to have Lieutenant Gordon
with us, but that seems to be impossible. Get
your guns ready, and I&#8217;ll arrange for a railroad
motor car to take us to Gatun.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I just believe Lieutenant Gordon is in
trouble,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;He was in the hotel
this afternoon, just before they carried the sick
man out, but has not been seen since.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned sprang to his feet, all excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did they carry a sick man out?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it must have been about five o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
was the reply. &#8220;He was plumb sick, too, for
they carried him out in a wheel-chair, with a
sheet over his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who carried him out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the men from the hospital who were
sent for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What floor?&#8221; demanded Ned, a thought he
did not care to put into words coming to his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third floor,&#8221; replied Peter. &#8220;I stood out
there, looking around, when the chair was
brought down on the freight elevator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greatly to the amazement of the boys Ned
darted away. In a minute he stood before the
clerk&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you have a boy show me to Lieutenant
Gordon&#8217;s room?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but you won&#8217;t
find him in. There have been repeated inquiries,
for him this afternoon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has any one been to his room?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it is locked and the key is not here.
I was up on that floor about five o&#8217;clock, when
the hospital people took a man out of the room
next to his, and his door was locked then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned stood for a moment in deep thought,
hesitating, wondering if the clerk was a man to
be trusted in a great emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look to me like a dependable man,&#8221; he
finally said to the clerk, &#8220;anyway, I&#8217;ve got to
take you into my confidence. Will you take
duplicate keys to the lieutenant&#8217;s room and the
room next to it and come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if it is anything important,&#8221;
replied the clerk, &#8220;but you&#8217;ll have to give some
good reason before I can admit you to either
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step in here,&#8221; Ned said, motioning toward
a little check room at the end of the counter.
&#8220;You saw the sick man carried out?&#8221; he asked,
as the clerk wonderingly stepped into the designated
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him taken out. He was a
stranger&mdash;took the room about noon through a
friend. I did not see him at all, that is, until
he was carried out, and then I did not see his
face.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure it was not Lieutenant Gordon
who was carried out?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, why, he wasn&#8217;t sick. He said nothing
to me of being ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he has enemies on the Isthmus,&#8221; Ned
went on, &#8220;and is now at work on a very delicate
and dangerous job for the government. Suppose&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk waited to hear no more. He seized
the keys asked for and bounded toward the elevator,
taking Ned with him. When they entered
the lieutenant&#8217;s room they found it in great
disorder. There were many signs of a desperate
struggle. On the floor was a three-cornered slip
of paper which had evidently, judging from the
quality and thickness, been torn from a drawing
roll. The scrap showed only two irregular
lines, but Ned recognized them.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gordon had taken into his possession
the crude map of the Gatun dam which
Ned had discovered in the old temple bomb-room.
The next room, the one from which the
alleged sick man had been taken, was also in
disorder, and the door which connected the two
apartments had been forced open. There was
a strong odor of chloroform in both rooms.</p>
<p>The clerk did not need to be told what had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
taken place. His face turned white as chalk
and his voice trembled as he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is to be done? Think of the lieutenant
being carried off from this hotel in the daytime.
It will ruin us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; Ned replied, &#8220;you must make up
your mind to keep what has been done a profound
secret. You may tell the proprietor if
you see fit to do so, but no one else must know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the secret service men must be told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;I have an idea
that I can restore the lieutenant to his friends
without any row being made over the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how? I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; Ned urged, &#8220;wait until two o&#8217;clock
to-morrow morning. I am going out now on
an expedition which may reveal many things,
if I succeed. If I fail, why, then you must notify
the secret service men and look for me in
some of the pools about Gatun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk finally consented to this arrangement,
and in ten minutes Ned and his chums
were speeding toward Gatun on a railroad motor
car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>THE SPOIL OF THE LOCKS.</h3>
</div>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock that night the workmen
employed at the locks, the spillway, and the
barrier of the Gatun dam found that their lights
were not working satisfactorily and sent word
back to the electric department that something
was amiss.</p>
<p>The electric department sent word back to
the men in the excavations that the lights were
all right so far as they were concerned, that they
were doing their full duty efficiently, and that
the men with the shovels, the dynamite and the
dump cars might go chase themselves.</p>
<p>This expression of fact and permission did
not make it any lighter at the workings, but the
men kept on, in the intermittent showers of
illumination, and grumbled while they excavated
and piled in the concrete. At last, just before
midnight, the incandescence did not come back
to the globes, and the men gathered in groups
to discuss the matter and express heated opinions
of the efficiency of the men in charge of the
lighting plant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>The workmen moved about here and there
in the shadows and clambered like ants over the
great bulk of the dam. No one looked to see
that the men assembled in the workings all belonged
there. At midnight four men who did
not belong there entered the excavation which
leads from the bottom of the lower lock to the
sea-level channel into Limon Bay, which is a
child of the Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>These four men moved about as if accustomed
to the situation, only now and then they
halted and whispered together. Other men,
workmen, were doing that, however, and so
these four passed on up to the foot of the spillway
without attracting attention.</p>
<p>Here they separated, one to the west, one to
the east, where the locks are, and one to a position
half way between the spillway and the west
side of the locks. The fourth man remained
near the foot of the spillway.</p>
<p>Due primarily to its size, Gatun dam has
received, perhaps, more attention in the United
States than is its due. There is nothing especially
difficult or complicated about this dam,
and many dams have been successfully built
in this country to withstand much larger pressures
and greater heads of water than the Gatun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
dam without being given one-quarter of the
attention.</p>
<p>Gatun dam fills the opening between the
hills at Gatun through which the Chagres river
flows to the Caribbean Sea. It consists, if it
may be regarded in the light of a finished production,
of a water-tight center or core composed of
sand and clay mixed in proper proportion and
deposited hydraulically; that is by being pumped
in.</p>
<p>On each side a wall of rock confines this core.
The bulk of the dam rests on impermeable material
of sufficient supporting power. The locks
and spillway are considered a part of the dam.</p>
<p>The locks are built in an excavation at the
east end of the dam, in rock, and will lift vessels
from the Atlantic level to the level of the Lake
of Gatun. The spillway is a concrete-lined
opening cut through a hill of rock near the center
of the dam. When supplied with suitable gates,
it will regulate the level of the lake.</p>
<p>The dam proper is about 9,000 feet long over
all, measured on its crest, including locks and
spill way, but for only five hundred feet of this
great distance will it be subjected to great
pressure. During this space there is, or will be,
a weight of about eighty-five feet depth against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the barrier. For only about half its length will
the head of water on the dam be over fifty feet.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the above description
that the point of attack on the dam would naturally
be where the pressure is greatest, also at
the locks, which would make a mighty channel
for the flood of water, and which would be difficult
to repair. The spillway, too, if enlarged by
explosives, would make a nasty hole to build up.</p>
<p>Now another point which Ned had considered
when he looked over the crude drawings he had
discovered. Hard rock underlies the dam near
the surface of the ground except for about one-fifth
of its entire length. Here the rock dips
down to a minimum depth below sea-level of
from 195 feet in the depression east of the spillway
to 255 feet in that west of the spillway.
Here, of course, would be another point of
attack by one designing permanent mischief.</p>
<p>These depressions or valleys have been slowly
filled during past ages. Measured from sea-level
down, the first 80 feet consists of sand and
clay; the next 100 feet or so is stiff blue clay,
while the last 20 to 60 feet is a conglomerate,
composed of sand, shells and stone. It will be
readily seen that great damage might be done by
a raging torrent boring into the sand and clay
of the first strata.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Now, the outer walls of rock are 1,200 feet
apart, the interval being filled with spoil from the
canal and lock excavations. The south &#8220;toe,&#8221;
as it is called, has a height of 60 feet, while the
north or down-stream &#8220;toe&#8221; is 30 feet high.
Spoil from the excavations will be dumped outside
the &#8220;toes&#8221; until the dam is 2,000 feet in
width at the bottom. The top of the dam is, or
will be, 30 feet above water level and have a
width of 100 feet. The channel of the spillway is
300 feet wide.</p>
<p>Ned had figured it out that one attacking the
dam would naturally seek to enlarge the locks
and the spillway and also to burrow in under
the bulk of the dam where the sand and clay had
been washed in below sea-level by countless
years of flood and storm. The locks and spillway,
enlarged, would require years of active
work for repair; the sand and clay, if subjected
to high explosives, would cause the crest of the
dam to drop in on the north side and so enfeeble
the entire structure, requiring the gigantic
work of constructing new foundations.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Ned saw the four men moving
toward the spillway, saw them part and seek
the vulnerable points which have been described
above, he knew that the time he had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
waiting for had come. The treacherous rascals
were there to do their wicked work that night&mdash;to
carry out plans long formed and well considered&mdash;and
they were opposed only by the
inexperienced patrol leader from New York and
his three chums, Frank Shaw, Glen Howard,
and Peter Fenton. It will be remembered that
Jimmie McGraw, Jack Bosworth, and Harry
Stevens were at the old stone house on the road
to Las Cruces from Gamboa, and that George
Tolford had accompanied Tony to the Chester
camp.</p>
<p>On reaching Gatun the boys had slipped out
of the lights of the station and descended immediately
to the bottom of the cut. They were
at once accosted by a foreman, but the explanation
Ned gave seemed more than sufficient, for
Dan Welch, the man in charge of a group of
workers on the locks, at once summoned his
assistant to the job and remained with the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard about you, Ned Nestor,&#8221;
Welch said; &#8220;in fact, about half the men in the
workings at Gatun have heard of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how,&#8221; replied the
puzzled boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, through that bomb business at the
cottage. You see, it leaked out. When the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
attempt to blow up the place was reported,
the men naturally asked what the dickens the
scamps wanted to blow up a crowd of sightseers
for, and then it came out that you came here
with Lieutenant Gordon, and that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was at this time that the lights suspended
operation. Welch glanced about the busy scene
for an instant and sat down on a box which contained
tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The electric men work
as they please. We&#8217;ll wait here and lose our
record. Did you say where Lieutenant Gordon
is to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not, because I wasn&#8217;t asked,&#8221; was
the reply, &#8220;and because I don&#8217;t know where
he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good fellow, Gordon,&#8221; Welch exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;d go far and fast to do him a favor.
I hope he&#8217;s coming out of this game all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ned sat down on the tool-box and told
Welch the story of the abduction of the lieutenant,
and also the story of what was going on
there that night, as he understood it. To say
that Welch was profoundly excited does not half
express the foreman&#8217;s state of mind as he listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried, when Ned paused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
&#8220;To think of the wickedness of the thing. To destroy
the work of years. To delay the completion
of the canal for a decade. What can we do?
In this darkness, the spoilers can work their will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know who they are,&#8221; Ned said.
&#8220;We must find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad that the lights should fail us
just at this time,&#8221; the foreman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea that the plotters arranged
for that,&#8221; Ned said, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; demanded Welch. &#8220;The plants
are well guarded. You know, of course, that we
are all on the lookout for something of the kind?
We thought we had provided against any sudden
surprise. Where are we to look for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ned pointed out the probable points
of attack, and Welch sprang to his feet in a
fuming passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spillway and the locks,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;And the point where the soft earth extends
under the dam! Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring four of your men who can be trusted,&#8221;
Ned advised, not leaving the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send a man to the light station and have
tracers sent out, but instruct him not to have
the lights turned on until you give the signal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; the foreman said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
catch them with the goods!&#8221;</p>
<p>Four men, workmen, were strolling along the
danger points within five minutes, and another
moved toward the electric switches which governed
that part of the illumination. Ned and
Welch remained near the spillway. The three
boys, after whispered instructions from Ned,
moved along the line passing word from man
to man.</p>
<p>It was a long and heart-breaking half hour,
seemingly double that time, that followed. The
man from the switches came back and whispered
to Welch, and at that moment a shrill bird-call
sounded in the darkness. This, in turn, was
followed by the report of a revolver, and then
the light leaped into the globes, making the
place, the entire length of the canal dam, the
spillway and the locks, as bright as day.</p>
<p>There came a half-hearted explosion from
the direction of the locks, followed by more shots.
Then everything was in confusion, and groups
of men gathered in four spots along the line.
There were more shots and then the three boys
rushed, panting, to the position Ned and the
foreman had taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got them!&#8221; Frank cried. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
got every man of them&mdash;four Japs with lighted
fuses in their hands!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be more than four!&#8221; Welch
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; Ned replied. &#8220;This is hardly
a job for many men to work on! The four dare
not take others into their confidence. Come!
Suppose we gather them in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you boys know they&#8217;ve got them
all?&#8221; demanded Welch. &#8220;The four men must
be some distance apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too far for a revolver to carry a signal!&#8221;
smiled Ned. &#8220;You probably noticed four groups
of shots? Well, the boys who have been acting
as messengers from man to man gave directions
as to the number of shots for each group!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; said Welch. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need any
whiskers, boy, to do the brain work of a man.
Here comes the first batch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Itto and Gostel were the first ones brought
in. Itto was wounded fatally and Gostel was
bleeding from a wound in the side. The other
men were not injured. They stood in a little
group for a moment, and then Itto dropped to
the ground.</p>
<p>The reports of the men who had been sent
out to the danger points showed that each one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
of the four had been caught lighting a fuse, the
bombs having been set.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were forced to work before we were
ready,&#8221; Gostel said, defiantly. &#8220;Our government
discovered what was going on, and we
would have been arrested to-morrow. So we
were obliged to take the risk to-night. We were
working for the glory of the Emperor, but he
forbade it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not believe the government of Japan
would descend to any such despicable work,&#8221;
Ned said. &#8220;You fellows are cranks! You would
have worked great harm to your Emperor if you
had succeeded. By the way,&#8221; he added, &#8220;what
did you do with Lieutenant Gordon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gostel glared at his questioner, but Itto beckoned
Ned to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old stone house on the road to Las
Cruces!&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221; asked Welch, who had
bent over the wounded man and heard the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; replied Ned. &#8220;One act of this
tragedy has already been pulled off there. Have
your men take these cranks to Gatun and get a
railroad motor. We must get to Gamboa without
loss of time. It is only a short distance from
there to the place he speaks of. If they took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Lieutenant Gordon there a prisoner, they are
likely to have had a warm reception, for three
of my chums are there!&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was not necessary for them to go to
the old stone house. At Gamboa they found
Lieutenant Gordon and the three boys. Jimmie
excitedly related the sensational occurrences at
the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack and Harry came up,&#8221; he concluded,
&#8220;just as the two men, Pedro and Gaga, were
going together with knives. I was scared into
a trance! The boys covered them with guns an&#8217;
we trussed &#8217;em both. You never saw people more
surprised in your life. Then two men brought
in Lieutenant Gordon, all nicely tied up, and
went away, or started to go away. Well, they
wasn&#8217;t prepared for an attack from the bushes,
and we have four prisoners in a cell of a jail at
Gamboa, right over there!&#8221;</p>
<p>In an hour the boys were all back at Culebra,
with Lieutenant Gordon looking angry enough
to eat sinkers, as Jimmie said. The officer
though pleased at the general results, did not
like to admit that he had been captured by the
enemy and rescued by the Boy Scouts, the little
fellows he was guarding!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>THE TANGLE STRAIGHTENED OUT.</h3>
</div>

<p>It was nearly daylight when the tired party
entered the lobby of the hotel at Culebra. The
eight men who had been captured were all under
strong guard, the bombs had been taken from
the dam, and the danger was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Lieutenant Gordon said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll go
after the men higher up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started back as he uttered the words, for
Mr. Shaw, Harvey Chester, Col. Van Ellis, George
Tolford, and Tony Chester came hastening
toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three of the men higher up!&#8221; the
lieutenant shouted. &#8220;I arrest you, gentlemen,
for treason!&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men drew back in surprise and Mr.
Shaw stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I sailed
from New York the day after the boys left, but
reached Culebra only to-night. When I came
here I found Mr. Chester and Mr. Van Ellis
waiting for news from Ned Nestor. What does
it mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It means!&#8221; shouted Gordon, &#8220;that your
dupes are all under arrest, through the efforts of
Nestor, and that the Gatun dam is no longer in
danger. It also means that you three men are
under arrest! I suspected, that night in your
house in New York, Shaw, that you were trying
to lead me to a false trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw glanced indifferently at the officer
and motioned to a distinguished looking gentleman
who had been observing the scene from a
distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is Colonel Hill, your chief,
Gordon. He came on from New York with me.
Let him speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the others are prisoners,&#8221; insisted
Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; Mr. Shaw said, &#8220;that
Nestor knows more about the complications of
this case than any one else. Suppose we let him
sum it up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he can do it!&#8221; growled Gordon.</p>
<p>Although it was now broad daylight, and all
were tired and in need of sleep, the party went
to a private parlor and Ned began the story of
the case, first having a short talk with Jimmie,
who had listened to a confession from Gaga.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The plot against the Gatun dam,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;did not originate with the business men who
were looking for emeralds along the line of the
cut. When I first sized up the case it seemed to
me that the men interested in emeralds, including
Mr. Shaw, were willing to delay the completion
of the canal in order that they might have time
to develop mines believed to be fabulously rich
in emeralds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way it looked to me,&#8221; the lieutenant
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began work along that line,&#8221; continued
Ned, &#8220;for the news that Mr. Shaw was interested
in emerald mines, and his refusal to reveal the
contents of the papers he had secured, led me to
the opinion that he had been approached by his
partners with a proposition to destroy the Gatun
dam, that he had their proposals in writing, and
that he had refused to become a party to such
an outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t he tell us who the men
were?&#8221; demanded Gordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;he did not think
his partners, Mr. Harvey Chester and Col. Van
Ellis, would go to the extremity proposed. He
thought they would change their minds when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
enormity of the crime was set before them. In
fact, he suspected from the first that they were
being urged on by others having private ends to
gain by the destruction of the dam. Besides,
he thought himself capable of handling the situation
alone. Is that true, Mr. Shaw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All true,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see
how you found out what was in my mind,&#8221; he
added, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all very clear to me, in time,&#8221; was
the reply. &#8220;Unless I am very much mistaken,
you, Mr. Shaw, fearful that the enemies of the
canal scheme might act too quickly, gave the
information to the government which led to
Lieutenant Gordon being put on the case. Is
that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;that is right, but
how&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All in good time,&#8221; Ned went on. &#8220;Now,
the fact that you had warned the officers of the
government became known to your associates in
the emerald business. That is, it became known
to the men who were drawing the associates
into this crime. It was then necessary for them
to get the papers they had given to you, the maps
and plans of the best points of attack. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
papers mentioned names, and would have convicted
every one of them of treason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get a glimpse of the papers?&#8221;
asked Mr. Shaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen them,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;but what took place shows what they contained.
When you left the Isthmus, Pedro, real name
Pedrarias, was induced by some of the conspirators
to go with you as your servant. His real
duty in your house was to steal the papers before
you turned them over to the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no intention of doing that,&#8221; the editor
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the conspirators did not know that,&#8221;
Ned went on. &#8220;Now, while Pedro went into your
employ for the purpose of stealing the papers
he also went for a purpose of his own. It was
his longing to possess the emerald necklace&mdash;which
had long been in his family&mdash;that induced
him to become a servant, though the large sum
of money the conspirators paid him was a consideration,
he being very poor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You all know what happened. Pedro did
not succeed in getting either the papers or the
necklace. He remained in the house until the
others became anxious and sent three men on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
New York to accomplish what Pedro did not seem
capable of doing. One of these men was Gaga
and one was Itto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working under instructions from his confederates,
Pedro let Gaga into the house about
six o&#8217;clock one rainy night. He remained inside
so long without reporting to those outside
that they demanded admittance, and Pedro was
obliged to let them in. This must have been
about nine o&#8217;clock. When Itto and the other
man entered, they went at their work roughly.
They assaulted Mr. Shaw and searched his rooms
which had already been searched by Gaga.
Then they went upstairs to search Frank&#8217;s room,
and Pedro tried to turn them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not trust them, being afraid they
would secure the necklace. By the way, the
chances are that he did not know that Gaga was
still in the house. Well, when Pedro opposed
their passage and Frank ran out, the two fled,
finding the night-bolt off at the street door.
Then Gaga got the necklace and got out of the
house during the excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be well to say here that Pedro did
not leave the house to further conspire with
the canal plotters. When he found that Gaga
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
had indeed stolen the necklace he went after
him. He did not care where the others went,
or whether they secured the papers or not. It
was the second man, the one with Itto, who followed
us on board the boat and was named His
Nobbs by the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro went back to Mr. Chester, who had
been prominent in locating him in the Shaw house,
and waited for a chance at Gaga. By this time
both Mr. Chester and Col. Van Ellis had decided
to turn the plotters over to the government and
take their chances on arrest, for of course the
arrested men would accuse them of being at the
head of the conspiracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Col. Van Ellis was going to lock us up and
see how long we could go without food!&#8221; Frank
exclaimed. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t look much like the
work of a contrite heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not have been starved,&#8221; Van
Ellis replied, with a smile. &#8220;At that time our
friends, the Japs, were watching our every movement,
and Mr. Chester and myself agreed to let
them play their game a little longer in order that
they might be caught and punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the mysterious Jap men you
are talking about?&#8221; demanded Jack Bosworth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
&#8220;I am anxious to know how they tangled these
three business men up in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true,&#8221; Ned asked of Mr. Shaw, &#8220;that
Gostel and Itto first proposed delaying the work
on the canal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; they first suggested it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They told you of emerald mines under
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they never took you to see the mines?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we took their word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they lied to you. There are no emerald
deposits under the line of the canal. Their
purpose was to get you involved in a scheme to
blow up the dam, believing that you, by your
influence, would be able to ward off suspicion
after the job had been accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they are cranks. They believed
they would be doing their Emperor a great favor
by destroying the canal. They were insane on
the subject. They believed that Japan could
never become mistress of the Pacific with the
canal in operation and the fleets of the world
passing through it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they carried on the plotting, made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
their bombs, and fought us boys, as you all
know. Their plans were progressing satisfactorily,
for they did not know that Mr. Shaw,
Mr. Chester, and Col. Van Ellis would have
stopped them at the risk of their own lives, had
they been able to do so, until the Japanese government
got wind of what was on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then these cranks were warned by the
Japanese officials to stop. Instead of doing so
they abducted Lieutenant Gordon and advanced
the date of the crime one night. The abduction
was cleverly planned and executed, but Mr.
Chester learned of it, and there was a row about
it. But there was no suspicion on the part of
Mr. Chester that the job was set for last night,
I take it. Is that true?&#8221; he asked, turning to
Mr. Chester.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was completely deceived, and only
that you boys were on guard the dam would
have been blown up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I overheard their plans in the stone house,&#8221;
Ned continued. &#8220;Mr. Chester and Col. Van
Ellis went there to call the whole thing off, but
Gostel and Itto lied to them. I heard Gaga
admit to Itto that there were no emeralds under
the canal line. I found there another map of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
the dam, with marks where the bombs were to
be placed. Then, when I got back to Culebra
and found that Lieutenant Gordon had been
abducted, I knew that the job was set for that
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sorry you went without me,&#8221; Mr.
Chester said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted you here when the end came,&#8221;
Ned replied, &#8220;and so sent for you. I wanted
you where you could not be accused of complicity
in the crime, for I knew that you were innocent.
Your only fault was in listening to the men at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we should have listened to Mr. Shaw
instead of the Japs,&#8221; Mr. Chester admitted,
&#8220;but it has come out all right. The peril is over.
Now, what about the necklace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaga carried it with him, lugged it about
on his person,&#8221; Ned said, &#8220;and Jimmie secured
it after his arrest at the stone house. Pedro
would not have been captured if he had not
followed Gaga there with the intention of murdering
him and securing the necklace. Yes, the
bauble is in Frank&#8217;s possession again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that closes the case,&#8221; laughed Mr.
Shaw, &#8220;and you boys may as well go back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
New York with me. The reward for your work,
Mr. Nestor, will be large, and you may as well
take a rest. We will leave the prisoners in the
hands of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment!&#8221; said Col. Hill. &#8220;We are
in need of a herd of Boy Scouts, just like this
one, up in the Philippines. Will you go, boys?&#8221;</p>
